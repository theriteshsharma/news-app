The recall was issued after the agency discovered an issue with the heat system in certain Tesla vehicles.  Transport Canada reported that a little over 2,084 Tesla vehicles were affected by the recall. The recall affects 2021 and 2022 Model 3s and Model Ys. It also affects 2020, 2021, and 2022 Model S vehicles. According to the report: “Certain vehicles could have a loss of cabin heating in cold temperatures. If this happens, the windshield defrost and defog system may not work properly.”  (Credit: Transport Canada) (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); The primary safety risk occurs when the defrost or defog system does not work properly, making it difficult for the driver to see through the windshield. Transport Canada reported that “reduced visibility could increase the risk of a crash.” The agency noted that the issue only affected Tesla cars with firmware release 2021.44 through 2021.44.30.6. Transport Canada informed Teslarati that Tesla must notify current owners about the problem within 60 days of notifying the agency. It continues to examine complaints involving the heater and defroster performance on Tesla Models. As of February 1, the agency has received 171 consumer complaints concerning the performance of heating, ventilation, and air condition system (HVAC) during cold weather conditions in Tesla Model 3 and Model Y vehicles. Transport Canada opened a defect investigation at the Issue Assessment level concerning Tesla on January 5, 2022, after it received six consumer complaints about HVAC systems in Tesla Model 3 and Model Y vehicles. The National Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) issued a similar recall in the United States. The US regulator noted in its Safety Recall Report that a Tesla software error caused some of its cars’ heat pumps to open unintentionally, adversely affecting their defrosting capabilities.

En total, según las estimaciones de Canalys, se vendieron 6,5 millones de este tipo de vehículos -incluyendo los totalmente eléctricos y los híbridos enchufables- en todo el mundo durante el año pasado, un 109 % más que en 2020, alcanzando ya un 9 % de las ventas totales de vehículos a nivel global. De la citada cantidad, más de 3,2 millones fueron en China, donde los eléctricos ya representan un 15 % de las ventas de vehículos, doblando así el porcentaje del año anterior. \"Se lanzan muchos nuevos modelos cada mes en cada uno de los segmentos importantes del mercado, desde pequeños urbanos económicos (...) hasta sedanes \'premium\' y SUV\", indicó el analista de Canalys Jason Low, que asegura que \"todavía hay grandes oportunidades de crecimiento en 2022 y más adelante\". En el caso de Europa, la cifra nominal es menor (2,3 millones) pero la porcentual supera a China, con un 19 % de eléctricos sobre el total de coches vendidos en 2021. En Estados Unidos, la tasa de adopción es mucho menor, con 535.000 unidades, que representaron el 4 % de las ventas de automóviles del año. A nivel mundial, Tesla repite como marca líder con un 14 % de la cuota de mercado, seguida del Grupo Volkswagen (12 %) y las chinas SAIC (11 %) y BYD (9 %). En el caso de SAIC, buena parte del éxito se debe atribuir a su modelo \'low-cost\' Wuling Hongguang Mini EV, que parte de en torno a unos 3.900 euros (unos 4.500 dólares), lo que lo coronó como modelo más vendido en la China continental en 2021.', NULL, NULL, 'https://www.infobae.com/america/agencias/2022/02/14/china-represento-la-mitad-de-las-ventas-globales-de-coches-electricos-en-2021-2/', '2022-02-13 23:00:36', 'united states of america', NULL, '2023-07-07 05:13:57', '2023-07-07 05:13:57', 2, NULL, NULL, 0),

One of the potential locations for Tesla’s next factory is the District of Shenyang.  Liaoning Province released an announcement on its official WeChat account. It published an article with a title roughly translating to “Five Grasps of Dadong District of Shenyang City, Striving to be the Pioneer in Revitalization Development.” The article lists five goals Liaoning Province wants to achieve and depicts the next steps to make it happen. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); The fifth goal in the article mentions Tesla specifically. It states several areas Liaoning Province plans to grow and improve, such as the renewal and reconstruction of the Wanquan area of East Middle Street and the construction of cultural industry parks. The last goal also mentions opening up spaces for industrial development and the intention to “lay the foundation for the implementation of major new energy vehicle projects such as Tesla.”  Some local Chinese news outlets believe Tesla’s deal with Liaoning Province is not set in stone yet, but local governments are already competing for Tesla’s next factory in China. The article does reveal that Tesla is actively working on locating a spot for a second Gigafactory in China.  At the last earnings call, Elon Musk announced that Tesla would be building new factories at new locations in the future. Liaoning Province’s latest WeChat announcement suggests Tesla has already started the search for a new Gigafactory site. Shenyang seems to be a viable location for Tesla’s next factory in China. As per Prologis, Shenyang’s major industries include auto, chemicals, plus construction and equipment manufacturing.  It makes sense that Tesla is interested in another factory in China, given the success of Giga Shanghai. In its recent 10-K SEC filing, Tesla reported a revenue of $13.844 billion in the Chinese market for 2021. Tesla’s income has increased over 100% in China since Giga Shanghai started operations in 2019. Tesla’s posted a revenue of $2.979 billion from China in 2019 and $6.662 billion in 2020.

In het crypto nieuws deze week zagen we nieuws over grote bedrijven, de Europese Unie en inflatie voorbij komen. In dit nieuwsoverzicht lees je een overzicht met het belangrijkste nieuws. Inflatie zorgt voor bitcoin stijging, maar ook daling Te beginnen met wat bitcoin nieuws. Deze week werden de inflatiecijfers voor januari bekendgemaakt voor zowel Nederland als andere landen. De cijfers die het meeste impact hadden op de bitcoin koers waren die uit de Verenigde Staten. Daar steeg de inflatie in januari tot maar liefst 7,5%. Dit zorgde in eerste instantie voor een aardige stijging. Bitcoin is immers een zogenoemde inflatie hedge die door zijn schaarste mogelijk bescherming kan bieden tegen de waardevermindering van geld. Maar niet veel later kwam het besef dat de Amerikaanse centrale bank mogelijk door de inflatie de rentepercentages zal gaan verhogen. Deze onzekerheid zorgde voor een correctie naar beneden. KPMG, Tesla, BlackRock, Uber en… Bitcoin! Dan nieuws omtrent een aantal grote namen. Wat betreft adoptie was het namelijk een behoorlijk positieve week voor bitcoin en crypto in het algemeen. Zo werd duidelijk dat de Canadese tak van het wereldberoemde accountancybedrijf KPMG bitcoin en ethereum (ETH) aan zijn balans heeft toegevoegd. Later in de week maakte Tesla bekend eind 2021 nog $2 miljard aan bitcoins te hebben. Kortom, het lijkt voor nu stevig vast te houden aan zijn BTC. Op 10 februari werd bekend dat een andere grote naam van plan is crypto te betreden, namelijk ‘s werelds grootste vermogensbeheerder BlackRock. Het wil crypto-diensten gaan aanbieden aan klanten. Uber, een alternatieve taxidienst, volgde de vermogensbeheerder niet veel later in zijn voetsporen. Digitale euro in samenwerking met Ripple? Ook op politiek vlak was er weer interessant nieuws. Zo wil de Europese Commissie in 2023 een wet op tafel hebben liggen die de fundatie moet leggen voor een digitale euro. Ripple (XRP) zal hieraan een steentje bij gaan dragen. Wat betreft cryptocurrencies die niet door de overheid worden gecontroleerd was er minder positief nieuws. Dit keer liet de gouverneur van de Hongaarse centrale bank weten een algeheel verbod op crypto trading en mining te steunen. Eerder stelde een andere Europese toezichthouder al zo’n verbod voor. Of het ooit zover gaat komen is nog maar de vraag.

Con ello, por su parte, también nació lo que se denominó como ‘Crew Dragon’, la cápsula para la misión que se lleva a cabo desde la nave del Dragon 2. Pero, ¿cómo es y qué consiste? SpaceX tiene con ‘Crew Dragon’ un proyecto histórico En 2020, la Administración Nacional de Aeronáutica y Espacio (NASA), junto con SpaceX, la empresa del magnate Elon Musk, lanzaron al espacio una nave que tuvo como destino la Estación Espacial Internacional. En su caso fue con la nave ‘Crew Dragon’, que marcó un hito histórico con el que se buscaba encabezar el inicio de los viajes comerciales al espacio. Con todo, hablamos de Space X como la empresa estadounidense de transporte aeroespacial fundada por el magnate de Tesla (y otros), Elon Musk. Hasta la llegada del ‘Crew Dragon’, el proyecto más importante de SpaceX hasta entonces resultó ser es el cohete Falcon Heavy, que contó con una potencia y una capacidad de carga superior a la del Saturno V, un cohete de la NASA lanzado por última vez en 1973 que formó parte de las misiones Apolo con destino a la luna. En esas, SpaceX quiere llevar su nuevo plan e invención a otro nivel. Y nada mejor que hacerlo con la super idea del ‘Crew Dragon’, el cual se refleja como el más importante de la nave espacial Dragon 2 de la empresa. Ahora bien; ¿cómo es y de qué trata este proyecto? ¿Qué tiene de particular y por qué se habla de él como un hecho histórico? De qué trata Partamos de la base de que se trata de una nave espacial, de la misma SpaceX, que tiene como objetivo subir a órbita. Y es que, tras años de desarrollo, la empresa estadounidense certificó la que es su primera cápsula que lleva a humanos al espacio. Esta, como tal, es la conocida como ‘Crew Dragon’. De hecho, en ella se pueden llevar hasta 4 personas al espacio. Está propulsada gracias al cohete reutilizable Falcon 9, un cohete que se ha demostrado es seguro y que es capaz de volver a la tierra y aterrizar sin un rasguño, algo que por muchas veces que lo veamos, no se hace viejo. El caso es que ‘Crew Dragon’ es una cápsula espacial que es totalmente diferente a lo que hemos visto hasta ahora. Su diseño es totalmente limpio y nada que ver con los paneles con millones de botones que tienen otras naves. En 2021, y tras algunas probaturas previas, la NASA lanzó y reutilizó tanto la nave como el cohete, un gran paso para SpaceX. La cápsula utilizada en esa misión es la Endeavour, la misma utilizada en la misión Demo-2, y la nave el conocido Falcon 9 de la misión Crew-1. Del mismo modo, es la primera vez que un astronauta de la ESA viaja a bordo de una nave de SpaceX. La intención es reutilizarla para las siguientes misiones y así abaratar costes. Un diseño moderno y futurista Tripulada por turistas espaciales, SpaceX reveló que su ‘Crew Dragon’ se conforma con una cúpula transparente a través de la cual los tripulantes pueden disfrutar de panorámicas espaciales increíbles durante sus trayectos. Como se evidencia en las imágenes del siguiente vídeo, su diseño es moderno y con un toque futurista que lo hace ver como si fuese una película de ciencia ficción de los años 90′. Totalmente autónoma, es equipada con un sistema de aborto de emergencia diseñado para expulsar a los astronautas a un lugar seguro si algo sale mal. Además, en él se cuenta con un sistema de paracaídas para aterrizar la nave espacial de manera segura en el improbable caso de que uno de los cuatro paracaídas principales falle. Este el gran paso final antes de que el programa de tripulación comercial de la NASA certifique a la cápsula como el vehículo para misiones operativas de larga duración en la estación espacial. Esta certificación permitirá continuar las investigaciones tecnológicas que sientan las bases para la exploración futura de la Luna y Marte a partir del programa Artemisa, previsto para 2024.

So far, it looks like folks from all ages and walks of life will join the season in the hopes of becoming the next Sole Survivor. And, of course, there are quite a few younger players as well. The youngest cast member is reportedly still in her teens — and she looks up to one of the richest men in the world. Here’s more about her. CBS released the official ‘Survivor’ Season 42 cast listing ‘Survivor’ Season 42 cast | Robert Voets/CBS Entertainment Eighteen contestants will duke it out in Fiji for their chance at the $1 million prize. So, who’s in the Survivor Season 42 cast? Entertainment Weekly reports the women in the cast include Chanelle Howell (29), Marya Sherron (47), Tori Meehan (25), Swati Goel (19), Lindsay Dolashewich (31), Lydia Meredith (22), Jenny Kim (43), Maryanne Oketch (24), and Drea Wheeler (35).

This season will reportedly take on the 26-day format that season 41 took on, too. Screen Rant reports the change from 39 days to 26 was due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) and scheduling, so it seems the new season will continue this. Many of the advantages first seen in season 41 will also return, like the Beware Advantage. Additionally, Jeff Probst is back at the helm to host. The youngest player is just 19 years old and idolizes Elon Musk Swati Goel from the ‘Survivor’ Season 42 cast | Robert Voets/CBS Entertainment Swati Goel is the youngest player on the Survivor Season 42 cast. We’re excited to see how well she works with the rest of the cast, especially with those who are over twice her age. According to Us Weekly, Goel comes from Palo Alto, California, and she’s an Ivy League student. She describes herself as “competent, charismatic, and caring,” and she also noted she doesn’t like people who dream big but don’t work for what they want. She also doesn’t like emotional manipulation or others who try to control her. As for her personal idol, she looks up to Tesla and SpaceX founder Elon Musk. “My life’s mission is to change the world for the better,” she told the publication. “Building something like Tesla, which is uber-successful and also a boon to the environment, is my dream.” Can the youngest player bring home a win? Jud “Fabio” Birza was just 21 years old when he won Survivor: Nicaragua, so it’s certainly possible. When is ‘Survivor’ Season 42 coming out?

The movie’s message is timely, its satire is frighteningly realistic, and its characters are very compelling, from Leonardo DiCaprio’s exasperated Dr. Randall Mindy to Sir Mark Rylance’s dangerous billionaire tech CEO Peter Isherwell.  Rylance’s performance as Isherwell is particularly noteworthy in the film, especially considering that the character was obviously based on the template of a tech billionaire. And in a recent interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Rylance confirmed that while he looked at CEOs like Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg, and Jeff Bezos for inspiration, his character Peter Isherwell is based in no small part on SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); According to the Academy Award-winning actor, individuals like Musk have very high-minded ideas about what they’re doing, and hence, they do not think that they are bad people at all. Rylance, however, warned that this is also what makes individuals like the Tesla and SpaceX CEO dangerous.  “I looked at all those fellas. Maybe I should have gone down that more Californian, high-tech thing. But I went for something slightly different. I did read Elon Musk’s book — about half of it. But I certainly thought a lot about that mindset of men and technology being the greatest thing in the universe, that nothing else is a higher force, and anything that nature throws at us, we’ll deal with it.  “They’re thinking they’re doing good — so there’s that scene where he gets upset when Leonardo’s character thinks he’s just a businessman. These people have very high-minded ideas about what they’re doing. They don’t think they’re bad people; quite the contrary. You get that impression from Elon Musk. They think they’re going to save humanity. I think they’re dangerous,” Rylance said.  In the film, Isherwell was characterized as an influential businessman who has significant pull on the United States president. His tragic flaw was represented in his insistence to use experimental technology and rockets to address the movie’s main threat. Ultimately, Isherwell’s plan doomed the world, and it was thanks in no small part to the billionaire’s hubris. While the award-winning actor’s observations about Musk’s grandiose ideas about saving humanity may be true, Isherwell’s character in Don’t Look Up is ultimately a rather surface-level take on the SpaceX CEO. Musk, after all, tends to be very bold on his targets and ambitions, but he has rendered some serious results. This is quite true for SpaceX, which has brought back the capability to launch American astronauts from American soil to the United States with its Crew Dragon program. SpaceX was able to accomplish this by sheer hard work and caution, and that’s at least partly credited to Musk’s tenacity. Plus, anyone who’s followed Tesla news over the past couple of months would likely conclude that Musk does not necessarily have a lot of influence with people in power. US President Joe Biden would not have taken so long to say the word “Tesla” if that was the case, and the US would probably be looking into the implementation of a carbon tax if Musk really was that influential.

However, they’re not the only options, and wood is a surprisingly practical alternative.</p><p><a href=\"https://coco-mat.bike/\" target=\"_blank\">COCO-MAT.bike</a> is a Greek company founded in Athens that’s aiming to prove that lithium and timber are a winning combination. It’s not just a proof of concept, either - COCO-MAT currently makes six bikes (Odysseus, Penelope, Telemachus, Mentor, Telegonus, and Argos), with various gearing options and two electric models.</p><p>The bikes are certainly striking – the entire frame is made from pale wood, from the handlebars to the fenders – and they could soon be rolling through a street near you. TechRadar spoke to to find out why your daily rider should be made from timber.</p> <h2 id=\"branching-out-5\">Branching out</h2> <p>If you’re thinking ‘COCO-MAT’ sounds like an unusual name for a bike builder, you’re right. The company, which was founded by brothers, Paul and Mike Evmorfidis in 1989, mainly focuses on sustainable furniture, bed linen, and mattresses.</p><p>“Paul is a little on the crazy side,” says Dimitri Philippou, CEO of ARTC GLOBAL, which is bringing the bikes to the UK. “He’s the one who’s big on the environment – In fact, he’s on the Amazon on a river ride now.</p><p>\"A few years ago, he was riding in the Alps, his bike broke down, and he decided ‘I’m going to make a wooden bike\'. That’s where it came from.”</p> <figure data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class=\'image-full-width-wrapper\'><div class=\'image-widthsetter\' style=\"max-width:2048px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\"><img id=\"xZZerQhTxD9XutgdJAA7CE\" name=\"COCO-MATBIKE E-bike.jpeg\" alt=\"COCO-MAT wooden e-bike\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xZZerQhTxD9XutgdJAA7CE.jpeg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1152\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" ><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: COCO-MAT)</span></figcaption></figure> <p>The first wooden bikes were built about six years ago. At first they were used as a marketing tool, but they proved surprisingly practical and people were so interested that the brothers decided to turn them into a proper business. They began selling wooden bicycles soon after, and three years ago branched out into e-bikes as well.</p><p>The bike frames are made of American ash from forests that are dedicated to growing trees for lumber. “It’s very environmentally focused and very durable,” Philippou says. “From each tree we can make 50 bikes, and our commitment is that we plant a tree for every adult bike we sell, so it’s a net positive.”</p><p>The frames are cut by machine, then sanded and assembled by hand – a manufacturing process that releases much less carbon than traditional bike building. </p> <h2 id=\"grit-wind-and-fire-5\">Grit, wind and fire</h2> <p>Philippou says that riding the two-speed and seven-speed models feels just like a regular bike. They aren’t meant for off-road use, but they can handle gravel, and the springiness of the wood provides a little natural shock absorption.</p><p>Still, the climate in Athens is very different to northern Europe – how can a wooden bike handle the notoriously wet UK climate? “The wooden bikes are treated to repel water,” he explains.</p><p>“In fact, the frames that originally had a three-year warranty are now going to have a lifetime guarantee. In the process of time we’ve seen how durable the bikes are, and now we feel confident.” The non-wooden components, including the gearing, has a one-year warranty, and the warranty for the battery is two years.</p><p>The company assures riders that wooden e-bikes need no more TLC than conventional ones (check out <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/e-bike-maintenance\">our complete guide to e-bike maintenance</a> for details).</p><p>“Their minimal design and operation leaves almost no space for things that can go wrong,” says Philippou. “Drum brakes and automatic gears ensure almost a lifetime operation without maintenance. If anything fails in the course of the years though, our expert cycle repair shops partners in the United Kingdom will do the job.”</p> <figure><blockquote><p>Drum brakes and automatic gears ensure almost a lifetime operation without maintenance</p><figcaption><cite>Dimitri Philippou</cite></figcaption></blockquote></figure> <p>The use of wood raises a question about flammability, though. <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/e-bike-fires-why-they-happen-and-how-you-can-prevent-them\">TechRadar recently spoke to the Fire Protection Research Foundation</a> about best practice for avoiding e-bike fires, but does a timber frame pose an additional risk?</p><p>“The frames, of course, are treated for fire so there’s no problem there and there is short circuit and thermal protection through the battery pack\'s management system,” Philippou explains.</p><p>In accordance with EU laws, the motor only kicks in while the rider is pedaling. The current battery has a range of 40-50km, much like a conventional mid-range e-bike, but the company is currently working on a new model that will keep rolling for up to 100km on a single charge. It’s also investigating the possibility of using Tesla batteries in future bikes.</p> <h2 id=\"what-apos-s-next-5\">What\'s next</h2> <p>The UK business will begin online at first, with the official launch happening around March 18 to tie in with Ride to Work Week. Later on, COCO-MAT hopes to open several stores in cities like Oxford, Cambridge, and London where riders will be able to buy and rent the bikes.</p><p>“You can have cycle tours, and that will be exciting,” Philippou says. “In addition to all the beautiful sightseeing locations around the UK, you get to experience it on an iconic, sustainable bike. The excitement is to see the bikes on the streets.”</p> <ul><li><a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/best/best-folding-e-bikes\">The best folding e-bikes</a></li></ul> </article>', NULL, NULL, 'https://www.techradar.com/news/sustainable-stylish-and-springy-wooden-e-bikes-could-be-the-future-of-commuting/', '2022-02-13 06:30:32', 'india', NULL, '2023-07-07 05:13:57', '2023-07-07 05:13:57', 3, NULL, NULL, 0),

Aunque Musk no descartó errores o fracasos, el director de SpaceX confía en que el cohete espacial Starship que emplea tecnología reutilizable desarrollada por la compañía, alcanzará órbita para el final de este año. “Probablemente habrá tropiezos en el camino, pero queremos resolverlos con misiones de satélites y de pruebas”, declaró Musk antes de colocar personas a bordo. Asimismo, Elon Musk reveló que espera contar con la aprobación por parte de la Administración Federal de Aviación (FAA, por sus siglas en inglés), en marzo. De esta forma, en los próximos meses SpaceX podrá continuar con la fase de lanzamiento del Starship desde Boca Chica hasta la órbita terrestre. En caso de que la FAA requiera mayores informes sobre los posibles impactos ambientales derivados del lanzamiento y surjan algunos contratiempos con los permisos, tendrán que recurrir al Centro Espacial Kennedy de la NASA . Sin embargo, en caso de que esto suceda el lanzamiento se retrasaría más de medio año, afirmó Musk, añadiendo que la nave también podría despegar desde plataformas flotantes ubicadas en los mares de cualquier parte del mundo. Por primera vez, Musk dio una actualización sobre Starship en más de dos años. El cohete previamente conocido como Sistema de Transporte Interplanetario (ITS), tiene 9 metros de diámetro, 50 metros de altura y está hecho casi en su totalidad de compuestos de fibra de carbono. La NASA contempla emplear el Starship para llevar astronautas a la Luna para el 2025, mientras que Musk, espera desplegar una flotilla de Starships para crear una ciudad en Marte, transportando equipo y personas al planeta. Se esper que los cohetes se lancen tres veces al día y se reabastezcan a través de estaciones localizadas en el espacio para facilitar viajes hacia destinos más distantes, como Marte, detalló el fundador y presidente de SpaceX. Por ahora, los vuelos iniciales transportarán los satélites de internet de USK, llamados Starlink, a órbita. De acuerdo con el magnate, el lanzamiento del Staship tendrá un costo de menos de 10 millones de dólares, refiriéndose a que es un precio “locamente bajo”, así como “ridículamente bueno” para los estándares espaciales actuales.

Disponible avec une motorisation 100 % électrique, cette version représente 20 % des ventes de 208 en France l’année dernière. Peugeot propose ce modèle à partir de 149 €/mois en ce moment, l’occasion de décrypter cette offre qui a plutôt l’air attractive. 162 000 voitures électriques ont été vendues en France en 2021, ce qui représente une hausse de 45,6 % par rapport à l’année précédente. En décembre dernier, l’électrique a même atteint les 15 % de parts de marché, se rapprochant ainsi à grands pas du diesel, dont les PDM étaient de l’ordre de 17 % sur la même période. Il faut dire que les offres en matière de véhicules branchés sont de plus en plus nombreuses, et les clients ont désormais le choix sur un même produit avec des offres de motorisations multiples, comme c’est le cas chez Peugeot. Disponible aussi bien en diesel qu’en essence, la voiture la plus vendue en France l’an passé (86 961 immatriculations) est aussi disponible depuis son lancement en électrique. La Peugeot e-208 // Source : Peugeot France 20 % des Peugeot 208 neuves vendues en France en 2021 ont été des e-208, soit 17 858 immatriculations pour la citadine électrique française. Elle occupe la troisième place des voitures électriques les plus vendues en France en 2021 derrière la Renault Zoé (23 573) et la Tesla Model 3 (24 911). Pour aller plus loin Quelles voitures électriques neuves pour moins de 30 000 euros ? Si vous êtes tenté par l’achat d’une VAE, et notamment d’une Peugeot e-208, la firme au Lion propose actuellement une offre de financement plutôt intéressante. Votre conseiller commercial favori vous a sûrement déjà fait l’éloge des financements qu’il propose, et notamment en LLD ou LOA : location longue durée et la location avec option d’achat. Pour différencier les deux, c’est simple, vous « louez » la voiture dans les deux cas durant un laps de temps défini au moment de signer le contrat de location. La différence entre ces deux offres de location arrive à la fin du contrat, au bout de 3, 4 ou 5 ans. Avec la LOA (location avec option d’achat), vous aurez le choix entre lever l’option d’achat (préalablement définie au moment de signer le contrat) ou bien de restituer le véhicule. La LLD (location longue durée) n’inclut pas d’option d’achat à la fin du contrat. En d’autres termes, vous restituez la voiture. Ces financements permettent d’afficher certains modèles à des tarifs mensualisés qui sont psychologiquement plus accessibles. En regardant de plus près ces offres, plusieurs conditions sont à respecter. De quoi parfois repartir bredouille quand le loyer affiché et placardé sur Internet et sur tous les canaux de communication passe du simple au double si on ne remplit pas toutes les conditions. C’est pourquoi, au sein de cette rubrique, nous vous proposons un décryptage des offres du moment. Nous allons regarder d’un peu plus près quelles sont les conditions à remplir et si, économiquement parlant, ces financements peuvent convenir à l’usage que vous aurez du véhicule. Et aujourd’ui, après avoir décrypté l’offre du Škoda Enyaq iV disponible à partir de 299 €/mois, celle du Kia EV6 à partir de 297 €/mois, et celle du MG ZS EV à 99 €/mois, nous allons nous intéresser à la Peugeot e-208 à 149 €/mois. Quel est le modèle de Peugeot e-208 proposé au tarif de 149 €/mois ? Chez Peugeot, contrairement à d’autres marques, l’offre ne fait pas forcément la Une du site Internet. Néanmoins, en quelques clics, on tombe rapidement dessus, au milieu d’autres offres assez alléchantes dans l’ensemble. En s’y intéressant d’un peu plus près, et en parcourant les petites lignes des conditions générales, on remarque que le véhicule présenté en photo n’est pas totalement celui concerné par l’offre. Un grand classique chez les constructeurs. On met en photo un modèle haut de gamme avec la tarification « à partir de » du modèle d’entrée de gamme. La belle Peugeot e-208 que vous n’aurez pas à 149 €/mois. La Peugeot e-208 qui est affichée en photo est une version « GT », soit le plus haut niveau de finition pour la e-208 qui n’est pas affichée au même prix. Mais alors, qu’avons-nous pour 149 €/mois ? Nous avons une e-208 avec la finition « Active », c’est-à-dire le deuxième niveau de finition sur les six proposés dans la gamme 208, et le premier niveau sur les cinq proposés sur la e-208. En d’autres termes, il s’agit du modèle d’entrée de gamme. Comme toutes les autres Peugeot e-208, la motorisation et la batterie ne changent pas, la marque ne proposant qu’une seule variante électrique à son catalogue. Ainsi, ce modèle bénéficie d’un moteur électrique de 136 chevaux et 260 Nm de couple. La batterie, d’une capacité de 50 kWh, permet d’effectuer 340 kilomètres selon le cycle WLTP. La finition « Active » permet de bénéficier, de série, des feux à LED, du régulateur de vitesse, de la climatisation, d’un écran tactile de 7 pouces ou encore d’un chargeur embarqué de 7,4 kW monophasé. La couleur de base est plutôt sympathique d’ailleurs, une fois n’est pas coutume, car il s’agit d’un modèle « Jaune Faro ». En revanche, si vous souhaitez ajouter une ou deux options (y compris les couleurs), vous sortez immédiatement de l’offre et les mensualités grimpent. Quelles sont les conditions pour être éligible à l’offre LLD de la Peugeot e-208 ? Il s’agit d’une offre de location longue durée sur 36 mois et 30 000 kilomètres maximum. Comme le mentionne explicitement l’annonce, un apport de 3240 euros est obligatoire pour profiter des 149 €/mois. Cet apport comprend d’ores et déjà la déduction du bonus écologique maximal de 6000 euros éligible jusqu’au 30 juin 2022. Pour aller plus loin Bonus écologique 2022 : tout ce qu’il faut savoir avant d’acheter une voiture électrique Cette offre est soumise à la prime à la conversion de 2500 euros conditionnant la mise en rebut d’un véhicule diesel immatriculé avant le 01/01/2011 ou d’un véhicule essence immatriculé avant le 01/01/2006. Avec votre LLD, Peugeot intègre évidemment l’entretien et la garantie du véhicule, et même l’assistance, ce qui n’est pas forcément toujours le cas. Combien vous coûtera l’offre LLD de la Peugeot e-208 ? Sur trois ans de location, avec apport, votre Peugeot e-208 vous coûtera 8604 euros avec l’entretien, la garantie et l’assistance. Peugeot affiche sa e-208 à partir de 24 590 euros sur son site, bonus écologique de 6000 euros déduit et prime à la conversion de 2500 euros déduite également. À cela, Peugeot ajoute une prime reprise de 4000 euros, mais il s’agit en réalité de la prime à la conversion + une remise commerciale de 1500 euros. Pour aller plus loin Quelles voitures électriques neuves pour moins de 45 000 euros ? En partant de ce prix-là, vous paierez donc, sur trois ans, 34,9 % du prix de votre voiture. C’est globalement la dépréciation d’une voiture neuve après environ trois ans d’utilisation. L’offre n’étant pas une LOA, il n’y a pas d’option de rachat du véhicule. Il faudra obligatoirement le rendre à la fin de la location. Attention aux frais de remise en état, toujours chers au moment de la restitution. Nous vous conseillons de le faire avant chez un carrossier, cela vous coûtera moins cher qu’en concession. Si vous reprenez un véhicule chez Peugeot après votre LLD, le concessionnaire sera aussi un peu moins regardant sur les frais de remise en état. Quels sont les avantages de l’offre LLD de la Peugeot e-208 ? L’avantage, c’est de bénéficier d’une voiture 100 % électrique à des mensualités plutôt acceptables avec un apport relativement contenu grâce aux aides gouvernementales. Sans les aides et la remise de 1500 euros, le premier loyer serait de 11 740 euros. La Peugeot e-208 est globalement une bonne petite voiture électrique, avec un agrément de conduite appréciable et une autonomie plutôt correcte pour un usage urbain et périurbain, mais sans extra, notamment en raison d’un réseau de recharge encore peu dense. Quels sont les inconvénients de l’offre LLD de la Peugeot e-208 ? Des inconvénients, il y en a quelques-uns à cette offre, à commencer par la prime à la conversion qui exclut déjà pas mal de monde. Il y a ensuite l’offre, puisqu’elle est cadrée sur une voiture plutôt convaincante sous le capot, mais en matière d’équipements, c’est loin d’être la panacée. Pas de jantes en alliage mais des jantes en tôle avec des enjoliveurs, pas de radars de stationnement, pas de système d’instrumentation numérique et pas de GPS embarqué. Comme énoncé plus haut, et cela vaut pour tous les véhicules loués en LOA ou en LLD, les frais de restitution peuvent être élevés. Ils sont établis à la suite du passage d’un expert automobile qui met en lumière les éléments à remettre en état sur le véhicule. Avant de restituer votre véhicule, n’hésitez pas à passer par le professionnel de votre choix pour profiter de tarifs plus avantageux. La Peugeot e-208 // Source : Peugeot France Le kilométrage prescrit en trois ans est assez faible. 30 000 kilomètres sur la durée de location, cela donne 10 000 kilomètres par an, soit environ 830 kilomètres par mois et environ 27 kilomètres par jour. Cela pourra convenir à la majorité des clients qui utiliseront la voiture pour se rendre au travail, mais cela ne laisse pas beaucoup de marge pour les à-côtés. Pour de longs trajets, le réseau de recharge n’est malheureusement pas assez dense pour voyager sereinement (sans prendre en compte, en plus de ça, la fiabilité de certaines bornes), tandis que la Peugeot e-208 a bon appétit en électrons sur autoroute. L’autonomie sur ce type de parcours n’excède malheureusement pas les 200 kilomètres. À voir selon votre utilisation donc !

El Comité de Médicos para la Medicina Responsable (PCRM, por sus siglas en inglés) denuncia que la tecnología experimental y las pruebas de Neuralink llevadas a cabo en la Universidad de California, Davis, han conducido a los monos de prueba a sufrir graves problemas de salud y muerte, gracias a los electrodos implantados en sus cerebros. Con el objetivo de crear chips cerebrales que, según Elon Musk, permitan al ser humano desarrollar hiperinteligencia y a las personas lisiadas volver a caminar, el dueño de Tesla confundó Neuralink en 2016 junto con un grupo de expertos en neurociencia, bioquímica y robótica. De 2017 a 2020, comenzaron las primeras pruebas en animales y se implantaron chips en el cerebro de 23 monos en total; al menos 15 de ellos murieron, de acuerdo con la investigación del PCRM basada en registros publicados a través de la ley de registros abiertos de California. Monkey MindPong Picture-in-Picture “Casi todos los monos a los que se les colocaron implantes en la cabeza sufrieron efectos de salud bastante debilitantes (...) Estaban, francamente, mutilando y matando a los animales”, señaló Jeremy Beckham, director de defensa de la investigación del Comité, para The Post. Elon Musk prepara primeras pruebas de chips cerebrales en humanos El informe del PCRM es revelado luego de que Elon Musk y Neuralink anunciaran el pasado diciembre que esperan iniciar pronto las primeras pruebas de chips cerebrales en humanos, y que la compañía publicara una lista de trabajos para un director de ensayos clínicos este enero. El Comité de Médicos para la Medicina Responsable acusa a Neuralink y a la Universidad de California de nueve violaciones de la Ley Federal de Bienestar Animal, la cual regula la experimentación de compañías en animales. “Los monos experimentaron un sufrimiento extremo como resultado del cuidado inadecuado de los animales y los implantes de cabeza experimentales altamente invasivos durante los experimentos” expresó el grupo de defensores en su denuncia. “Estos implantes y su hardware asociado, que se insertan en el cerebro después de perforar agujeros en los cráneos de los animales, han producido infecciones recurrentes en los animales, comprometiendo significativamente su salud, así como la integridad de la investigación”, agregaron.

A panel of experts assembled by The Washington Post have reviewed and verified footage of Teslas equipped with the company’s beta Full Self-Diving (FSD) malfunctioning in terrifying ways. Unsurprisingly, they found that the driver assistance tech is likely doing more harm than good. In early February 2022, Tesla was forced to issue software updates to almost 54,000 of its cars that feature the company’s signature FSD program due to the cars’ propensity to not completely stop at stop signs. An increasing number of videos posted by Tesla drivers of their self-driving cars going haywire, though, seem to show that the issues with FSD go far beyond rolling stops. After reviewing six such videos, WaPo‘s panel of experts suggested that FSD may be too dangerous to use on public roads. In one of the more alarming analyses, the six experts — whose backgrounds include self-driving research, autonomous vehicle safety analysis and self-driving development — pointed out that one video of a Tesla not slowing down enough when a pedestrian crosses light rail tracks shows the Tesla FSD’s difficulty recognizing pedestrian walk signs and doesn’t seem able to understand that pedestrians may walk off sidewalks and into the roadway. Another of the more upsetting videos reviewed by the WaPo‘s panel details how the FSD prompted its driver to take over control of the vehicle when becoming confused by a truck partially blocking the street, but when the driver does so, they struggle to actually get control back from the driver assistance program and has to sharply turn the wheel repeatedly to do so. “I am taking over,” the driver says in the vehicle while jerking the wheel. “I’m — I’m trying.” “It’s unclear who exactly is in control at that moment,” Andrew Maynard, an Arizona State University professor who works in the school’s Risk Innovation Lab, told WaPo. “There’s an odd glitch here where there seems to be a short fight for control between the driver and the car. It appears there are scenarios where both driver and car potentially lose control at some points.” The glitch revealed in that video, Maynard added, is “important” because it demonstrates potential difficulties in “the ability of the human driver to ensure safety” in case of such malfunction. Here\'s a typical drive on Tesla FSD Beta, and why it\'s the opposite of useful. It\'s most certainly not even close to being \"safer than a human\", by any factor. 22-minute drive, 4.5 miles, and WAY too many interventions. pic.twitter.com/oKmkRZ3Tgh — Taylor Ogan (@TaylorOgan) February 1, 2022 Along with the experts’ analysis about the dangers posed by Tesla’s nascent FSD, WaPo also spoke to the drivers behind the videos to confirm their veracity — and one, identified only as Chris from Fenton, Michigan, said that after using his Tesla’s driver assistance program for about a year, he thinks it’ll be another decade before the program is truly be ready to be taken on the road. Expert criticism of Tesla is almost a cottage industry at this point, but for a Tesla owner himself to admit that the manufacturer’s self-driving mode isn’t ready for public consumption is striking.

Als onderdeel van de “Grote Vier” van accountancykantoren heeft deze beslissing in potentie een enorme impact op de adoptie van bitcoin. Nog geen twee jaar geleden zorgde MicroStrategy vooral voor gefronste wenkbrauwen in de financiële wereld met hun keuze voor bitcoin. Het grootste deel van de financiële wereld nam bitcoin destijds niet serieus. De tulpenbollenvergelijkingen worden tot op de dag van vandaag gemaakt. In de Bitcoin blootgelegd van deze week kijk ik hoe deze aankoop van KPMG daar weleens verandering in kan gaan brengen. We have just completed an allocation of cryptoassets to our corporate treasury, our firm’s first of its kind investment in the asset class. This includes Bitcoin and Ethereum tokens, and carbon offsets to maintain a net-zero carbon transaction: https://t.co/32hsKbnGuC — KPMG Canada (@KPMG_Canada) February 7, 2022 De afgelopen jaren heeft de financiële wereld mij geleerd dat men zelfs in de absolute top ‘maar wat doet’. Zonder nadenken roeptoetert het gros van de industrie elkaar na. Wat bitcoin lange tijd de kans heeft gegeven om zich onder de radar door te ontwikkelen. Na de investeringen van MicroStrategy, Block, Tesla en als kers op de taart KPMG Canada, lijkt de ondergrondse fase van bitcoin definitief voorbij. Het besef begint door te dringen dat bitcoin niet meer zal verdwijnen. KPMG Canada opent de bitcoin-poorten Het is onbekend hoeveel bitcoin KPMG heeft gekocht, maar dat doet er in eerste instantie niet toe. KPMG is een bedrijf met een marktwaarde van 32 miljard dollar dat een toonaangevende rol heeft in de financiële industrie. Partijen die nog twijfelden over de toekomst van bitcoin kunnen door deze stap van KPMG Canada over de streep getrokken worden. Het lijkt dan ook een kwestie van tijd voordat er meer ‘dominostenen’ omvallen. Als we de berichtgeving van Bloomberg mogen geloven, dan denkt KPMG Canada daar hetzelfde over. “Nu we zelf door dit proces zijn gegaan, zijn we ervan overtuigd dat we ook onze klanten en toekomstige klanten kunnen helpen om bitcoin op de balans te zetten,” zo laat KPMG weten aan het nieuwsplatform. De aankoop van KPMG Canada in combinatie met de bovenstaande mededeling lijkt de bevestiging te zijn die bitcoin nodig heeft. MicroStrategy heeft een aantal bedrijven overgehaald (o.a. Tesla en Block), maar de echte storm bleef uit. Nu lijkt KPMG als grote speler binnen de financiële industrie de poorten wagenwijd open te zetten voor bitcoin als reserve-asset op de balans. De komende maanden moeten uitwijzen in hoeverre dat waarheid blijkt te zijn. KPMG heeft macht om nadelige accountancy-regels om te buigen Op het moment van schrijven zijn de accountancy-regels in onder andere de Verenigde Staten nog niet in het voordeel van bitcoin. MicroStrategy en Tesla mogen alleen koersdalingen verwerken in de balanswaarde van hun bitcoin. Als de koerswaarde hoger is dan de aankoopwaarde mag dat pas verwerkt worden op het moment van verkopen. Wat een vertekend beeld kan geven van de financiële gezondheid van bedrijven met bitcoin op de balans. Het resultaat van die regelgeving is dat MicroStrategy er op papier een stuk slechter voorstaat dan in de realiteit. Wat uiteindelijk ook weer invloed heeft op de mogelijkheden voor financiering. Banken en andere financiële instellingen beoordelen je kredietwaardigheid onder andere op basis van de balans. Als die een vertekend beeld geeft, dan heeft dat een negatieve impact op je vermogen om kapitaal op te halen. KPMG heeft een grote vinger in de pap als het gaat om de regels voor accountancy. Het kan zomaar zijn dat MicroStrategy, Tesla en de andere partijen met bitcoin op de balans hierdoor meer kans hebben om iets aan die regels te doen. Mocht het op de korte termijn lukken om de regels gunstiger te maken voor bitcoin, dan kan dat ook weer een hoop partijen over te halen om voor een (kleine) bitcoin-allocatie te kiezen.', NULL, NULL, 'https://www.crypto-insiders.nl/nieuws/bitcoin/kpmg-canada-onderschrijft-toekomst-bitcoin-voor-financiele-sector/', '2022-02-12 08:34:09', 'netherland', NULL, '2023-07-07 05:13:57', '2023-07-07 05:13:57', 1, 'Bitcoin nieuws;accountancy;Adoptie;Bitcoin;Bitcoin blootgelegd;btc;KPMG', NULL, 0);

While admitting that he wears an Apple Watch for fitness tracking purposes, von Holzhausen opined that Apple\'s devices have become \"just a continuation\" and a \"slight refinement on the same thing.\" Apple Hit With Class Action Lawsuit Over \'Jelly Scrolling\' on iPad Mini A Colorado man this week filed a class action lawsuit against Apple that accuses the company of fraudulently marketing and selling the sixth-generation iPad mini despite being aware of a so-called \"jelly scrolling\" defect with the device. Apple last year told Ars Technica that the effect is normal behavior for LCD screens, but the lawsuit alleges that \"jelly scrolling\" is actually a defect that Apple is aware of and should either fix or acknowledge in marketing materials for the device.

With the immense wealth created for Tesla investors over the past decade, many investors are looking at other automotive companies that could provide similar returns for shareholders. Seeing the gigantic value the market has assigned Tesla, and the hundreds of thousands of vehicles it is now selling each year, legacy automotive companies have sped up production to get their own electric vehicles (EVs) out to customers.Ford (NYSE: F) is one of these companies. The 118-year-old Detroit automaker is investing tens of billions of dollars to ramp up EV production and is seeing great early signs of demand for its EV product lineup.

Bats in trees. An empty tank. These are just a few things that have stopped Tesla’s progress in Germany as it attempts to launch its first electric vehicle manufacturing facility in Europe. It has been a long and trying road for the electric automaker, which has attempted to surf through the waves of German bureaucratic red tape since early 2020. After another delay in the approval process, which has expected production start dates ranging across three quarters, industry experts challenge Germany’s reputation as a place for companies to conduct business. “Tesla shows the world how we stand in our own way,” Ferdinand Dudenhöffer, Director of the Center of Automotive Research, said. While Dudenhöffer does agree that Tesla should have treaded more carefully during the approval of a battery production facility and been smarter regarding document submissions, the industry expert believes that German red tape has mainly told a story of how hard it is to get things started if you are planning to open a business in the country. “But such hurricanes of resistance show how little sustainable Germany is,” he said in an interview with Handelsblatt. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Coverage of the Gigafactory Berlin project has spanned over two years for journalists in the sector, including myself. Musk announced that Tesla would bring a production facility to Germany in late 2019 while accepting an automotive industry reward. The project began just months later, in the early days of January 2020. More than two years later, a factory, a parage, a carnival, and a lot of speculation regarding when Tesla will finally receive the green light still exist. Earlier this week, German media reported that Tesla would likely not receive permission to begin production and deliveries until mid-March “at the earliest.” It is a far cry from the Summer 2021 start dates that many close to the project anticipated. The delays are starting to worry those who see Germany as a potential leader in the future automotive industry, which over the past ten years has changed more than it did in the previous ninety. Car companies are not just about making cars anymore. They’re relatively closer to tech companies than anything due to the advancements in software and the widespread focus on developing autonomous driving platforms. Regardless of what a company brings to the table, they will likely have to encounter some major pushback and delays in their project. Even EV leader Tesla is having problems. Dudenhöffer wonders which companies are observing the red tape and the pushback, thinking that other options may be better. Giga Berlin’s new graffiti panels as of early February 2022. (Credit: @Gf4Tesla/Twitter) It isn’t just companies, either. Dudenhöffer says that the renewal of motorway bridges can take years or even decades to be rebuilt completely due to new approval procedures. It is not about getting things done quickly, it seems. When things as simple as bridge repairs are taking over ten years to complete, there has to be an indication that the processes for planning and approval need to be revised. That is what Chief Executive Holder Loesch said, who encouraged the agencies responsible for approving projects to take a look at refining the approval steps. Loesch, whose association is overseeing the installation of wind turbines and industrial plants to double by 2030, says that his plans will include the submission of around 20,000 permits during the course of action. “This mammoth task can only be mastered with a comprehensive reform of planning and approvals that includes processes for industrial plant structures,” he said. Even Brandenburg Economics Minister Jörg Steinbach submitted ideas to help expedite potential approvals. Driven by the lagging approval process in the Tesla project, Steinbach said that “It should be possible to make changes to the building plan in the ongoing approval process without the process having to be completely restarted.” I’d love to hear from you!

Tesla Model S Plaid z 2021 roku to jedyny taki egzemplarz Wśród ogłoszeń na Ebay tego egzemplarza Tesli Model S Plaid nie da się nie zauważyć. Modyfikacja elektryka robi ogromne wrażenie. W zależności od gustu można ją kochać albo nienawidzić. Jedno jest pewne, taki kamuflaż może się przydać, żeby się ukryć w lesie albo przyciągać spojrzenia mieszczuchów. Tesla oryginalnie ma kolor biały i została oklejona 2 dni po zakupie. We wnętrzu jest pełno carbonu, bo jak twierdzi właściciel białe wnętrze ciężko utrzymać w czystości. Felgi to prawdziwa wisienka na torcie. Zbudowane przez Signature specjalnie dla tego samochodu, są niezwykle lekkie i owinięte w opony Michelin Pilot Sport 4S. Czarne wnętrze z kultową kierownicą Tesli oraz przyciemnione szyby dopełniają wyjątkowy wizerunek sportowego elektrycznego sedana. Zakamuflowany elektryk wyglądałby świetnie w wielu dostępnych grach wideo. Jedno jest pewne, w wyścigach na ćwierć mili robiłby wrażenie samym wyglądem. eBay Właściciel chętnie się zamieni na Audi R8 lub Porsche 911 Wygląda na to, że właściciel obłędnie szybkiego elektryka marzy, by znów poczuć znów zapach benzyny i słuchać dźwięku silnika sportowych samochodów. Jak pisze w ogłoszeniu, które znajdziesz tutaj, chce zakupić sportowe Audi R8 albo Porsche 911. Wystawia zmodyfikowany egzemplarz Tesli za oszałamiającą kwotę 543 907,98 złotych, która nie uwzględnia cła i podatku. Swoją drogą to zastanawiające, dlaczego posiadacz szybszego modelu, który kupił w zeszłym roku, powraca do słabszych osiągami sportowych samochodów. Widocznie prędkość i osiągi Tesli nie są na tyle atrakcyjne, by zabić tęsknotę za niepowtarzalnym brzmieniem silnika Porsche 911 i osiągami pięknego Audi R8. Sprzedać taki egzemplarz Tesli, na pewno nie będzie łatwo. eBay The post Wyjątkowa Tesla Model S Plaid jest na sprzedaż.

All the clues and theories', 'Who could it be?', 'Robobunny’s costume is a feast for the eyes (Picture: Vincent Dolman/Bandicoot TV/ITV/PA) The Masked Singer UK has had the nation putting their guesses hats on, particularly when it comes to star performer Robobunny in season 3 of the hit ITV show. The bizarre character has won viewers over with their performances, including their heart-melting cover of Saving All My Love For You by Whitney Houston. Judges Rita Ora, Mo Gilligan, Jonathan Ross, and Davina McCall have been left wracking their brains by the performances as they tried to guess which celebrity could be under the costume. Robobunny has now made it to the final alongside Panda and Mushroom, meaning that their identity will soon be revealed. So what are all of the clues and theories so far pointing towards the star who’s taken on the Robobunny persona? Let’s break them down. All the clues and theories for Robobunny so far Clues from episode 1 They initially had a cockney-sounding accent, which the judges thought might be fake.They’re a ‘real softie who’s part of a machine’.Peroxide polish was sprayed on the character. Perhaps a hint of their hair colour in real life?They have ‘hard exteriors’.They’re ‘here to control or delete what you know about me’.Their final clue during episode one was: ‘I might be made of metal, but that doesn’t stop me making a splash. Clues from episode 3 In their second VT, Robobunny entered a warehouse where a police badge, cowboy boots, a Native American headdress and a builder’s hat could be seen. While the judges initially thought they might be an actor, Mo then pointed out that each of the objects related to musical group the Village People.Robobunny said: ‘Nothing makes me happier than standing at my deck with nothing around me but a little bit of country,’ prompting the judges to think they could be from another country.They also revealed they love a bit of a dance, referencing line dancing. For their two lies and a truth, Robobunny said… These metal shoes are made for more than moonwalking.I’m not one for revenge, but I’ll always get payback.It was a knockout performance that launched my career. Clues from episode 5 The VT opened with Robobunny doing some gardening, hinting at it being a pastime of theirs.They said: ‘Rabbits come from big families, this bunny is no exception’ – so what big families in showbiz can you think of?Their dad – ‘Papa Bunny’ – is said to have ‘inspired their talent’, so it looks like their father could also be well-known.A pair of boxing gloves were seen embellished with the initials ‘MA’ – which some think could stand for boxing legend ‘Muhammad Ali’.They also referenced the ‘gospel truth’, so they could have a background in gospel music.Robobunny also said that people often remark: ‘Isn’t she good’ – so are they a female celebrity after all? Clues from episode 6 Cup of Joe – maybe a famous Joe or someone who has starred in Joseph References to ‘diva’Needs time to rest or will shut down completely Is someone who has reinvented themselves References to Grease – someone who has appeared in the musical, maybe? Clues from episode 7 Year 3000 – reference to Busted?Being able to put things in his own words is importantSoars to Great Heights Lots of references to rocketsImmortalised in Hall of FameHas circumnavigated the world 10 times Who do you think Robobunny could be? (Picture: ITV) So who have the judges picked as possible singers behind the mask for Robobunny? Which celebrities have been guessed so far? Mark Feehily Many people think it’s Mark Feehily behind the mask (Picture: Christie Goodwin/Getty Images) Many viewers are convinced that Robobunny is Westlife singer Mark Feehily. Several said that they recognised his voice instantly, while others pointed out that the clues mentioning line dancing might have been a connection to his home in Sligo, which had its own ranch. Vinnie Jones We wouldn’t be surprised if Vinnie was revealed behind the mask (Picture: Rodin Eckenroth/Getty Images) Someone with a hard exterior who’s really soft on the inside – of course Vinnie Jones comes to mind. People may be surprised to know that he also has a musical past, releasing his single Wooly Bully in 1993 and his album Respect in 2002. Drake Could Drake really have decided to come on Masked Singer UK? (Picture: Christopher Polk/Getty Images for Coachella) Mention of Robobunny having ‘control’ made the judges connect the dots to Drake’s song Controlla, from his fourth studio album Views. Paddy McGuinness Will the judges decide no likey, no lighty? (Picture: Matthew McNulty/Getty Images) All of the mechanics making up Robobunny’s costume could be a hint at another show featuring machinery… aka Top Gear, of which Paddy McGuinness is a presenter. Elon Musk To be honest, Robobunny seems like a likely alter ego for Elon Musk (Picture: Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images) When you look at Robobunny, and imagine a famous individual who’s heavily involved with robots, of course your thoughts are going to drift to Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla. Jeremy Clarkson Has Jeremy swapped his farm for the stage (Picture: David M. Benett/Getty Images) Another man involved in a car series, former Top Gear host Jeremy Clarkson, who since moved on to present The Grand Tour after his departure from the aforementioned programme. Billy Ray Cyrus Billy Ray Cyrus is a Grammy Award-winning artist (Picture by Frazer Harrison/Getty Images) During Robobunny’s second appearance, their VT made several references to country music and dancing. So of course, Billy Ray Cyrus, the Achy Breaky Heart singer, received a mention. Danny O’Donoghue The Script were first formed in 2007 (Picture: Rob Harrison/Getty Images) Rita’s train of thought led her to Danny O’Donoghue from The Script. Several symbols in Robobunny’s VT hinted at the singer being an actor, with the judge stating that actor’s read scripts, and therefore the singer could be none other than Danny from The Script. Richard Blackwood Richard Blackwood is a friend of Mo’s (Picture: Andrew Benge/Getty Images) Mo took a look at Robobunny’s name, taking the letters RB, which lead him to the assumption that it could be his friend, actor and rapper Richard Blackwood, who he described as an ‘all-round entertainer’. Kevin Bacon Could it be the Footloose star? (Picture: Frederick M. Brown/Getty Images) With all the references to line dancing in Robobunny’s video, it shouldn’t have been surprising that Kevin Bacon, who starred in the 1984 classic film Footloose, would be put forward as a suggestion. Will Smith Could it be the Fresh Prince behind the mask? (Picture: Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagic) Not only did Will Smith play Muhammad Ali in a biopic – which could be referenced by the MA boxing gloves in a Robobunny VT – but he also has an established music career. Jason Derulo Jason has the voice and the moves (Picture: Bryan Bedder/Getty Images for GQ) Having performed Dynamite by BTS on The Masked Singer UK, Jonathan put forward the idea that it could be Jason Derulo, considering the singer had a hit with the band.

In a media interview, Gadkari said he met the head of the Indian arm of Tesla \"three-four days back\". \"I have tried to convince him. Ultimately it is dependent on him to take the decision (to manufacture in the country),\" Gadkari told News 18. Stressing that Musk has to manufacture here first in order to roll out Tesla cars on the roads, the Minister said: \"Now his (Musk\'s) interest is to manufacture the Tesla car in China and make it sell in India. \"So, if you start here, you are welcome, no problem. But manufacturing in China and selling in India is not a digestible concept to all of us\". When asked about Tesla\'s demand to cut customs duties on electric cars, Gadkari said that the country cannot appease one automobile company. \"India is a huge market. We have all the world\'s automobile giants -- BMW, Volvo, Mercedes-Benz, Toyota, Honda, Hyundai -- present here. If we give one benefit to one company, we have to give that benefit to other companies also. That is the practical problem,\" he elaborated. Musk recently tweeted that he faced challenges from the government for releasing its products in India. \"Tesla isn\'t in India yet due to \"Challenges with the government\", he posted. Tesla has registered its office in Bengaluru as Tesla India Motors and Energy Private Limited and named three directors. The firm is registered with an authorised capital of Rs 15 lakh and paid-up capital of Rs 1 lakh. Earlier this week, the government questioned Tesla\'s business practices of seeking tax breaks to use the Indian market to sell its products, but not wanting to set up manufacturing facilities in the country which can generate thousands of jobs. \"We can\'t grant subsidies or relaxation in taxes to the said company as they don\'t want to set-up their manufacturing and other operation bases here. Why should we favour a company which create jobs in China and mints profit from our markets?\" Minister for Heavy Industries, Krishna Pal Gujjar, told the Lok Sabha in response to a question. \"Our Prime Minister has a vision for all such foreign companies, if you want to sell your product in our country, then manufacture them here only,\" Gujjar added. The minister informed the house that Tesla hasn\'t shown any interest in any of the government\'s schemes for electric vehicles. As per the Ministry of Heavy Industries, the government has formulated a scheme, Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid amp;) Electric Vehicles in India (FAME India) Scheme in 2015 to promote the adoption of electric/hybrid vehicles (EVs) in the country with an aim to reduce dependency on fossil fuels. --IANS', NULL, 'https://englishtribuneimages.blob.core.windows.net/gallary-content/2022/2/2022_2$largeimg_126797464.jpeg', NULL, 'https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/science-technology/tesla-manufacturing-in-china-and-selling-in-india-not-digestible-gadkari-369273', '2022-02-12 04:02:06', 'india', NULL, '2023-07-07 05:13:57', '2023-07-07 05:13:57', 3, NULL, NULL, 0),

Klamki ukryte w drzwiach samochodu są łatwe w obsłudze pod warunkiem, że nie zamarzną. Bez dźwigni ciężko samochód otworzyć. Kierowcy Tesli Model 3 i Model Y ręcznie otwierają klamki ukryte w drzwiach i na pewno bardzo chcieliby to zmienić. To rozwiązanie w przypadku ujemnych temperatur na zewnętrz sprawia, że dostanie się do wnętrza samochodu, jest niemalże niemożliwe. Kierowcy wówczas sięgają po jedną ze sprawdzonych metod, które zaprezentowali na Twitterze. Mówiąc najprościej, najlepszą metodą jest to by jej po prostu przyłożyć. Brutalna technika dotarcia do wnętrza Tesli, nie przypomina pukania do drzwi sąsiada, a raczej wejście jaskiniowca. Problem solved pic.twitter.com/0fvUKAPBND — Mona M (@Moanaaah) February 6, 2022 Gdybyś miał ocenić kierowców, za kreatywność na pewno spodoba ci się powyższe rozwiązanie. Jest to prawdopodobnie najbardziej widowiskowy sposób wśród rekomendacji właścicieli Tesli bez tradycyjnych klamek. W związku z tym, że potrzeba jest matką wynalazku, na Amazonie można kupić gadżet, który rozwiązuje problem właścicieli Modelu 3 i Modelu Y. Wystarczy zainwestować 45 dolarów, by nie silić się na kreatywność. Tesla opublikowała spektakularne nagranie.

The shares were worth roughly $2 billion at the time of purchase, making Soros Fund Management one of the firm’s largest investors. Rivian, which is 20% owned by e-commerce giant Amazon, was a hit with investors last fall, when it raised $12 billion in its IPO, becoming the largest market debut of 2021. However, the startup has not yet produced a consumer vehicle. As of December 2021, the carmaker has reportedly delivered just 150 of its electric R1T pickup trucks and only two electric SUVs, the R1S, to customers (mostly employees) with little revenue to report. It is hard to tell when non-employee customers will receive their Rivian cars, but the automaker began notifying non-affiliated reservation holders about when they could expect their vehicles in September last year. In a Rivian Owners forum poll, reservation holders said their R1S delivery dates are between June and September of 2022, while the majority of R1T respondents put down deliveries from March to June. Rivian was due to provide Amazon with more than 100,000 electric trucks last year, but said in December it expected production to fall “a few hundred vehicles short” amid supply chain constraints. READ MORE: \'Tesla killer\' startup shows how to become US’ biggest company earning nothing Apparently due to the failure to deliver on its promises so far, Rivian saw shares drop 43% for the year to date on Friday. The carmaker’s stock price is currently down 67% from the high of $179.46 it reached a week after its IPO debut.

Es soll Bomben und Zombiehorden widerstehen und ist ganz nebenbei eine atemberaubende Neuinterpretation des Atriumhauses.', 'Das passende Haus zum Cybertruck wurde in Moskau entwickelt. Es soll Bomben und Zombiehorden widerstehen und ist ganz nebenbei eine atemberaubende Neuinterpretation des Atriumhauses.Offenbar hat der futuristischen Cyber-Tuck ein russisches Architektur-Büro inspiriert, das passende Haus für das Auto zu entwerfen. Als der Chefarchitekt Alex Wizhevsky von Modern House Architecture & Design die Präsentation von Elon Musks Cybertruck sah, fragte er sich, was für eine Person solch einen Panzerwagen fahren würde und welches Haus wohl zu ihm passen würde.\"Anscheinend wurde das Auto geschaffen, um auch unter extremen Bedingungen zu bestehen. Es scheint mir, dass wir dazu ein gut geschütztes Haus, eine Art Festung, einen Bunker brauchen, in dem man jede Bedrohung sicher überleben kann.\"FS CyberhouseAuch ohne Zombies spannendDie Präsentation schwankt zwischen ernsthaften Elementen eines modernen Atriumhauses und Einflüssen aus der Horror-Reihe \"Resident Evil.\" Mitten in einer baumlosen Steppe gelegen soll die Behausung nicht nur gut aussehen, sondern auch noch Bomben und Zombies widerstehen. Eine launige Anspielung auf die Angst der Superreichen vor Aufständen und Apokalypsen, die sich weltweit im Bau von Kellern und Bunkern manifestiert.Ob die schrägen Wände nun wirklich anstürmende Zombie-Horden abwehren können, sei dahingestellt. Alex Wizhevsky sagte, dass sein Entwurf sowohl vom Tesla-Design als auch vom U-Bootbau inspiriert sei. \"Bei der Entwicklung des CyberHouse haben wir das Prinzip des Baus moderner Atom-U-Boote zugrunde gelegt, die aus mehreren Schutzhüllen bestehen\", sagte Wizhevsky. \"Die in unserem Projekt vorgeschlagene mehrschichtige Einhausung bietet maximale Sicherheit vor verschiedenen Katastrophen.\" Das Haus ist auf vollkommene Autonomie ausgelegt. Der Strom wird von Sonnenkollektoren und Windturbinen geliefert. Ziel sei es gewesen, das Überleben der Bewohner für ein Jahr zu garantieren.Industrielle FormspracheTatsächlich gelang dem Büro aus Russland eine interessante Neuinterpretation des Atriumhauses. Nach außen wirkt das Gebäude kühl und abweisend, nach innen öffnet es sich zu einem großzügigen Innenhof. Zwar gibt es noch keinen Auftraggeber für den Bau eines CyberHouse, aber der Architekt geht davon aus, dass mehrere Häuser, die dieser Designsprache folgen, verkauft und gebaut werden. Die Preise beginnen bei umgerechnet 775.000 Euro.Für Modern House Architecture & Design ist die gewagte Präsentation eine Möglichkeit, potenziellen Kunden einen Hinweis für eine zukünftige Architektur zu geben. \"Die Weltarchitektur und jetzt auch die Automobilindustrie, bewegen sich in Richtung Vereinfachung der Formen, maximale Nützlichkeit und Herstellbarkeit\", so Wizhevsky.Lesen Sie auch:Prepper rüsten sich für den Atomkrieg - was wir von ihnen lernen könnenFreiwillig in den Keller - darum wühlen sich die Superreichen in die Tiefe', 'https://image.stern.de/9089978/t/A9/v3/w1440/r1.7778/-/cyb--1-.jpg', NULL, 'https://www.stern.de/digital/technik/architekten-entwerfen-zombiesicheren-bunker-im-stil-von-teslas-cybertruck-9089954.html?utm_campaign=alle&utm_medium=rss-feed&utm_source=standard', '2022-02-12 02:29:00', 'germany', NULL, '2023-07-07 05:13:57', '2023-07-07 05:13:57', 2, 'Cybertruck;Bunker;Moskau;Architektur;Auto;Fahrzeug;1970er;Elon Musk;Neuinterpretation', NULL, 0),

According to von Holzhausen, the company is “feverishly” working on the vehicle, which will be an “exciting flying machine.” “We are working on the Roadster. I wish we were working faster, but I also wanted to say that, in the time we have been developing it, we have also been learning a lot… All those experiences will, you know, make their way back into a much better Roadster than had we launched right after we debuted it. No products can come fast enough from us for the public, but rest assured we are working on it feverishly,” the designer said. According to him, the highly anticipated hypercar will have an improved (with no further details given) version of Tesla’s new tri-motor powertrain launched in the updated Tesla Model S and Model X last year. And much more. Read more Elon Musk reveals Tesla’s top priority, and it is not cars “It will be an amazing, exciting flying machine with the SpaceX package,” von Holzhausen stated. Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced that the carmaker plans to add a “SpaceX package” to the Roadster, but the designer has now confirmed these plans. The ‘package’ refers to cold air rocket thrusters around the vehicle which are aimed at boosting performance. According to Musk, the technology will allow the Roadster to accelerate from 0 to 100kph in 1.1 seconds, and even allow it to fly, albeit briefly, as the CEO bragged on Twitter. The vehicle will also have a range of nearly 1,000km on one charge. However, the new generation of the Roadster is one of Tesla’s most delayed programs. First unveiled in 2017, it was scheduled to come to the market in 2020. The carmaker delayed the program on more than one occasion, with Musk stressing that the Roadster was not a priority for Tesla. This will actually be able to fly very briefly. I always laughed at flying cars & now making one. Fate 🖤 irony haha.— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 21, 2021 In 2020, Musk said the hypercar would be delayed until at least 2022 while the company focused on the release of the Tesla Cybertruck, which is also delayed. There has not been any news regarding the Roadster since September 2021, when Musk said the launch would be delayed even further – until at least 2023. The CEO also stated that the hypercar’s arrival will depend entirely on how much “drama” Tesla goes through in 2022, pointing to worries surrounding the lingering semiconductor chip shortage, which has already led to production delays at some Tesla factories. Despite the delays, 2021 was Tesla’s most successful year in its history, with full-year profits reaching $5.5 billion, up from $721 million in 2020, while sales soared 71% to $53.8 billion, compared to $31.5 billion in 2020. Tesla nearly monopolized the American electric car market in 2021, with over 72% of all electric cars sold in the US last quarter made by Tesla.

File image/PTI It’s bad news for Rahul Gandhi and his disqualification as a member of Parliament will stand. This comes as the Gujarat High Court rejected his request to put on hold his conviction in a defamation case over his 2019 Modi surname remark. Justice Hemant Prachchhak of the high court in his order stated that stated that the sessions court refusing to grant a stay on his conviction earlier was “just and legal”. He added that no injustice will be caused to Gandhi if the conviction is not stayed. Furthermore, the court mentioned that Gandhi was facing nearly 10 criminal cases, including a criminal defamation case by VD Savarkar ’s grandson. Related Articles Modi surname case: Gujarat HC rejects Rahul Gandhi\'s plea on stay of conviction Modi surname case: \'Judgement only redoubles our resolve to pursue matter further\', says Congress after Rahul setback According to an NDTV report, the Congress leader will now approach the Supreme Court with his request. But what was this case all about? Why was it important for Rahul Gandhi that the court granted a stay on the conviction? Here’s a full recap of the defamation case. What’s the case? In 2019, Purnesh Modi – a BJP MLA and ex-Gujarat minister – had filed a defamation case, under IPC sections 499, 500 and 504, against the former Congress party chief, Rahul Gandhi, for a comment that he made during at a campaign during the 2019 Lok Sabha general elections. The case stated that Gandhi at an election rally at Kolar in Karnataka on April 13, 2019 had said, “Why all the thieves, be it Nirav Modi, Lalit Modi or Narendra Modi, have Modi in their names”. The complainant held that Gandhi had defamed all people whose surname is Modi. According to rough estimates, there are about 130 million people in India who carry the surname. On 10 October of that year, Rahul Gandhi appeared before the court and pleaded not guilty in the matter. In March 2022, the Gujarat High Court had stayed the proceedings in the case after the complainant sought a stay citing lack of sufficient evidence. The stay was then lifted in February this year after Purnesh Modi told the High Court that there was sufficient evidence such as CDs and pen drives that had come on record of the trial court. During the course of the case, Rahul Gandhi’s lawyer, Babu Mangukiya, argued that it should have been Prime Minister Narendra Modi and not Purnesh Modi to have been the complainant in the matter as the prime minister was the main target of the Congress leader’s speech. Rahul Gandhi, of the Congress party, leaving the Surat court after being pronounced guilty and being sentenced to two years imprisonment in the defamation matter. File image/PTI On 23 March, this year, Surat’s court found Gandhi guilty of defamation and sentenced him to two years in prison. The court approved Gandhi’s bail on a surety of Rs 15,000 and suspended the sentence for 30 days to allow him to appeal. The two-year sentence led to the disqualification of Gandhi, an MP from Kerala’s Wayanad, under the provisions of the Representation of the People Act. The verdict also led to mass protests by Congress workers, opposing the verdict with several leaders slamming the decision. Multiple Opposition leaders also chimed in, with AAP leader and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal accusing the BJP of trying to “eliminate non-BJP leaders and parties by prosecuting them”. However, the BJP welcomed the decision and Ravi Shankar Prasad told a press conference: “The law of India is that if an individual or an organisation has been defamed by defamatory comments, abuses, then he has got the right to seek address but Congress has an objection to it. They want complete freedom for Rahul Gandhi to utter abuses”. The guilty verdict against Rahul Gandhi in the Modi surname defamation case led to nationwide protests. File image/AP What happened next? Following the verdict, Gandhi approached the Surat Sessions Court in April 2023, seeking suspension of sentencing and a stay on the conviction pending his appeal. However, the sessions court granted him bail but refused to stay the conviction. Gandhi then approached the high court with senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi telling the court that the trial was vitiated and the conviction did not fall under the category of moral turpitude or a serious offense as defined in various judgments. Moreover, Singhvi argued that a maximum punishment of two years for a bailable, non-cognisable offence meant his client could lose his Lok Sabha seat “permanently and irreversibly”, which was a “very serious additional irreversible consequence to the person and the constituency he represents”. A report by The Indian Express also said that Singhvi had stated that by denying the plea in such a case of alleged criminal defamation, the court will be “rewriting” the scope of CrPC Section 389. What about other cases? Incidentally, this is not the only Modi defamation case that Rahul Gandhi is facing. Advocate Pradeep Modi from Ranchi has filed a defamation case against the Congress leader, seeking damages worth Rs 20 crore for his comment that is perceived as being anti-Modi. Pradeep Modi in his petition claimed that while addressing a rally in Morabadi in Ranchi during the 2019 Lok Sabha election, Gandhi had referred to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, businessman Nirav Modi and Lalit Modi that “why all persons bearing the surname Modi are thieves.” The Jharkhand court has quashed the petition asking the Congress leader to be physically present and on 4 July also ordered that no coercive action should be taken against him. Besides these Modi defamation cases, there are other cases also filed against Rahul Gandhi. One of them was filed in 2019 by BJP municipal councillor from Ahmedabad, Krishnavadan Brahmbhatt. The matter relates to Rahul allegedly referring to Union Home Minister Amit Shah as a “murder accused” during a Lok Sabha campaign speech in Jabalpur. A case was filed against Rahul based on a 23 June 2018, tweet saying: “Congratulations Amit Shah ji, Director of Ahmedabad District Co-operative Bank, on your bank winning first prize in the conversion of old notes to new race. Rs 750 crore in five days! Millions of Indians whose lives were destroyed by demonetisation salute your achievement! #ShahZyadaKhaGaya”.

The court ruled that granting a stay on conviction is an exception and not a rule. The defamation case, which dates back to the 2019 Lok Sabha election campaign, revolves around Gandhi’s comment, “How come all thieves have the common surname Modi.” This remark was interpreted as an attempt to draw an implicit connection between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and fugitive businessmen Nirav Modi and Lalit Modi. Gandhi’s counsel, in a hearing held on April 29, had argued that his client could lose his Lok Sabha seat “permanently and irreversibly” given that the offence carried a maximum punishment of two years.

With the Dog Breeding and Marketing Rules (2017) and Pet Shop Rules (2018) coming into force, experts believe, animal breeders and pet shop owners will be made more accountable. Currently, illegal pet shops and breeding are mushrooming in Kerala, which has turned into a hub for exporting exotic animals and pets to other states. Though the state had kept the rules on the back burner for several years, the growing dog bite incidents have prompted the authorities to expedite measures to implement them. Sources say the State Animal Welfare Board (SAWB) has decided to strictly enforce the rules from November. There are thousands of pet shops and breeders across the state. and, at present, they obtain trade licences from local bodies. According to animal welfare organisations, this unauthorised industry has been operating without complying with the rules and regulations. This is one of the causes for the increase in dog attack cases in the state, they note. “Though it’s late, the government is finally trying to implement it,” says SAWB member Maria Jacob. “The condition of the animals is pathetic, and these people who run this as a huge business don’t care about their well-being.” Maria highlights that many pet shops operate on roadsides, just like a textile or a shoe shop. “At night, they shut the shop and leave the animals to suffer. This can’t be done,” she says. “They cram up the animals on display in small cages in stuffy rooms. This is a gross violation of animal rights, and it’s high time we put an end to it. Ideally, a pet shop should be in a compound, and there should be a caretaker to take care of these animals 24x7.” According to Maria, the state government has given enough awareness to pet owners and breeders in the state. “The department has been holding awareness classes and meetings for pet owners and breeders for so many years,” she says. “The problem is the government has been treating this business as a livelihood. Almost every other state has implemented the rules; they took strict action and several shops were sealed.” Maria adds that unethical and inhumane practices are rampant in the breeding industry, which, again, is a violation of the PCA Act. “Animals are forced to mate and deliver puppies unscientifically. After exploiting these animals, they are abandoned on the streets,” she fumes. “Many of the puppies born in this manner have health issues and defects. They are often abandoned.” Breeders, pet shop owners oppose move The government’s decision to implement the rules has not gone down well with the pet owners and breeders in the state. Those in the business claim the move is impractical. As per the new Breeding and Marketing Rules, a breeder will have to pay Rs 5,000 per annum for the licence. As per Kennel Club of India norms, breeding can be done three times in two years, but the new rules will limit this to once a year. “There are more than 10,000 registered and unregistered breeders depending on this business,” says Satheesh Kumar S, secretary of the Kerala Dog Breeders and Trainers Welfare Association. “We are not against rules, but these rules are unrealistic, hard to comply with. A large majority of the people running these shops are struggling, as pet sales have dipped. There was a boom during the pandemic. But now, people are hesitant to buy pets. Exports have also come down.” Satheesh argues that the rules were formulated without proper study of the ground realities or consultation with the stakeholders. “If implemented, this industry will collapse,” he says. “I am taking care of 30 dogs, and there are many breeders like me. Many of us will be forced to abandon the animals.” He adds that the association has urged the government to rethink. “The new rules mandate quarantine of animals for a week before selling them, and a vet should examine them before and after quarantine,” says Satheesh. “Also, if there are no takers for the pets at the shops, after two months, those animals should be handed over to animal welfare organisations.” State secretary of All Kerala Pet Owners Association P Rajesh echoes similar concerns. “As per the new pet shop rules, each puppy should be allotted 25sq.ft. About 90 per cent of the shops are running in spaces under 200sq.ft,” he says. “Also, the rulebook says different species should be kept separately. The shops should also have quarantine facilities. About 99 per cent of shops will have to shut down. There are around 3,000 shops under the association. We have employed around 10,000 employees working at these shops. There are thousands of shops that are not registered with us. Then, there are other ancillary businesses, like people selling animal feed. In all, about two lakh people will be impacted.” Keltron to provide platform The Kerala State Animal Husbandry Department has roped in Keltron to introduce an online platform for giving registration and licence for pet shop owners and breeders in the state.

Situated on the banks of the Kallar River in Konni, Pathanamthitta, Adavi has turned into a significant tourist attraction, thanks to its enchanting flora and fauna, soul-steering boat rides, and scenic beauty. The Adavi Eco-Tourism project is a joint initiative by the forest and tourism departments as the third phase of the Konni Eco-Tourism project which seeks to transform lesser-known areas in the district into a hub of adventure activities. You can reach here after getting down at the Chengannur railway station, just 25km away from Pathanamthitta town. Board a bus to Konni and from there, take a 10km ride through the jungle route by hiring a jeep or taking the bus. The narrow roads and tight turns, enveloped in the bewitching canopy of the jungle, can turn even the most mundane of bus trips into an adventurous experience. The main attraction at Adavi is the coracle ride in the Kallar which is available from 8.30 am to 5.30 pm. Four or five people can take a ride in the bowl-shaped bamboo raft. There are two boat ride packages. The short ride costs Rs 500, while the longer one costs Rs 900. The longer rides are available only during the monsoon when the water level is high. The one-hour ride spanned a distance of 2km and is advised for those looking for an adventure. Once you get on the coracle boat, gear up for an adrenaline-rush ride that starts from the Mundommuzhi Kadavu, bypassing Pandiyankayam and passing through Thottikayam and Thattathikkayam, before reaching Peruvali. Along the way, keep your eyes trained at the dense forest and you will most probably see wild animals drinking water from the banks of the river. During the thrilling long-distance ride, the oarsman will show his mastery by spinning the bowl boat. Make sure to hold on tight. But do not worry much as all travellers mandatorily have to wear life jackets before taking the coracle. Those looking for a scenic ride should opt for the shorter ride as it goes through serene waters. Another popular and attractive tourist destination in this monsoon season in Adavi is the Manneera Waterfalls, just 2km from the spot where the boat ride is offered. It is a small waterfall where tourists can relax and enjoy nature in all its glory. After the boat ride, the experience is complete with a night spent inside the tree-top bamboo huts close to the boat rides. While in Konni, you can also visit the famous elephant reserve and have a fun time with adult and baby jumbos. There is also an elephant museum detailing the history of the elephant species right from prehistoric times to the modern.', 'KOCHI: A thrilling boat ride and a captivating journey through the jungle during the monsoon should be on the bucket list of every travel enthusiast.

Former prime minister Scott Morrison, right, and former ministers Alan Tudge, centre, and Christian Porter, back left. Credit: Alex Ellinghausen Sealed section The royal commission said a sealed section of the report, which is subject to a non-publication order , “recommends the referral of individuals for civil action or criminal prosecution”. It is important to note that the identity of those individuals is not known. Two former ministers, Alan Tudge and Stuart Robert, have said they are not named in the section but it is unclear who is. “I am also submitting relevant parts of the additional chapter of the report to heads of various Commonwealth agencies; the Australian Public Service Commissioner, the National Anti-Corruption Commissioner, the President of the Law Society of the Australian Capital Territory and the Australian Federal Police,” Commissioner Catherine Holmes, SC, said. Critical findings about former ministers and bureaucrats 1. Scott Morrison The commission concluded that Morrison, who was the social services minister behind the robo-debt scheme rollout in 2015, “allowed cabinet to be misled” about the scheme. He rejected all adverse findings against him. “He failed to meet his ministerial responsibility to ensure that Cabinet was properly informed about what the proposal actually entailed and to ensure that it was lawful,” the report said. The royal commission heard the Department of Human Services advised Morrison in February 2015 that the robo-debt scheme would require legislative change. However, the policy proposal submitted to cabinet later that year did not say this was required. Morrison said he believed the legal issues had been resolved and his department “did come to a view in their formal advice that legislation was not required”. Morrison “allowed cabinet to be misled because he did not make that obvious inquiry” about why bureaucrats’ advice had changed, the report said. “Only a few weeks previously he had been told of that caveat; nothing had changed in the proposal; and he had done nothing to ascertain why the caveat no longer applied.” The commission also said it “rejects as untrue Mr Morrison’s evidence that he was told that income averaging ... was an established practice and a ‘foundational way’ in which DHS [the Department of Human Services] worked”. Income averaging referred to a process, subsequently found to be unlawful, under which Centrelink used data from the Australian Taxation Office to estimate the income of recipients of social security payments. This was a key plank of the robo-debt scheme. This automatic calculation created errors in some cases because it averaged out income into fortnightly periods, which may not have reflected the actual income received by recipients in that period. Centrelink then raised debts on the basis of that incorrect information. 2. Alan Tudge The commission referred in detail to steps taken by Alan Tudge, who was human services minister between February 2016 to December 2017, to respond to criticisms of the robo-debt scheme in the media. “Mr Tudge’s use of information about social security recipients in the media to distract from and discourage commentary about the scheme’s problems represented an abuse of that power,” the report said. “It was all the more reprehensible in view of the power imbalance between the minister and the cohort of people upon whom it would reasonably be expected to have the most impact, many of whom were vulnerable and dependent on the department, and its minister, for their livelihood.” Tudge responded: “I strongly reject the commission’s comments of the way I used the media and that I had abused my power in doing so. I reject that finding in the strongest terms. At no stage did I seek to engage in a media strategy that would discourage legitimate criticism of this scheme.” He said the information released was “generally de-identified” and was released to “correct the public record”. 3. Christian Porter The royal commission says Christian Porter, the social services minister between September 2015 and December 2017, “could not rationally have been satisfied of the legality” of the robo-debt scheme on the basis of his general knowledge of the policy process. “Mr Porter could not rationally have been satisfied of the legality of the scheme on the basis of his general knowledge of the [policy proposal] process, when he did not have actual knowledge of the content of the [proposal], and had no idea whether it had said anything about the practice of income averaging,” the report said. “As minister for Social Services, Mr Porter should at least have directed his department to produce to him any legal advice it possessed in respect of the legislative basis of the Scheme.” 4. Stuart Robert Stuart Robert was briefly responsible for robo-debt in mid to late 2019. The scheme was shut down in November 2019 after the Commonwealth settled a test case and agreed to orders declaring that key parts of the scheme were unlawful. The royal commission said it “rejects Mr Robert’s claim to have acted to end the Robodebt Scheme quite as promptly as he professes” and former Department of Human Services secretary Renee Leon took the first steps to end the scheme. “There is no reason to suppose, however, that had Ms Leon not taken the step she did, the government’s announcement of the cessation of the practice would have been far behind,” the report said. 5. Kathryn Campbell Department of Human Services secretary Kathryn Campbell was criticised by the robo-debt royal commission for failing to act when confronted with information pointing to the unlawfulness of the debt recovery scheme. “Ms Campbell had been responsible for a department that had established, implemented and maintained an unlawful program,” the report said. “When exposed to information that brought to light the illegality of income averaging, she did nothing of substance. “When presented with opportunities to obtain advice on the lawfulness of that practice, she failed to act.” Campbell served as secretary of the Department of Human Services from March 2011 to September 2017, which covered the period in which the automated debt assessment and recovery scheme was introduced.

Latest posts 3.07pm Centrelink worker who raised alarm lashes ‘cruel’ scheme By Angus Thompson Colleen Taylor, the former Centrelink worker who raised the alarm over robo-debt, said it was as if those who ran the unlawful scheme were missing an “empathy gene”. Taylor was a witness at the royal commission and was singled out by Government Services Minister Bill Shorten for standing up against the scheme while a frontline worker at the agency. “This only thing that stopped this in the end was that it was illegal,” Taylor said this afternoon as she pored over the royal commission report from her home. “Why wasn’t it stopped long before because of all the other reasons: immoral, unjust, unfair, cruel?” Taylor said she hoped people were identified who should no longer be working in the public service. “That will all come out when the sealed section [of the report] is implemented, but there are people who quite clearly, it’s like they have an empathy gene that’s been removed,” she said. 2.47pm Tudge ‘strongly rejects’ commission’s findings By Michaela Whitbourn Alan Tudge, who was human services minister between February 2016 to December 2017, has also responded to the robo-debt royal commission report. He said in a statement that he was examining the report with his lawyers but noted that the royal commission “made no finding that I had knowledge that the scheme was unlawful”. Former prime minister Scott Morrison and former minister Alan Tudge. Credit: Alex Ellinghausen “I note that the Labor Party never questioned its lawfulness until 2019,” Tudge said. He said people who had been referred to in a sealed section of the report related to potential civil and criminal action had “received prior notification”, and he had received no such notification. He said income averaging, the key feature of the robo-debt scheme that the Commonwealth accepted in 2019 was unlawful, “had been a feature of welfare compliance for decades”. Income averaging involved Centrelink using data from the Australian Taxation Office to estimate the income of recipients of social security payments in an attempt to identify people who had been overpaid. This automatic calculation created errors in many cases because it averaged out income into fortnightly periods, which may not have reflected the actual income received by recipients in that period. The commission heard evidence that part of the government’s defence of the scheme, executed by Tudge’s office, included the release of personal information about some Centrelink customers to correct what were said to be inaccuracies in the media. The royal commission said: “As a minister, Mr Tudge was invested with a significant amount of public power. Mr Tudge’s use of information about social security recipients in the media to distract from and discourage commentary about the scheme’s problems represented an abuse of that power. “It was all the more reprehensible in view of the power imbalance between the minister and the cohort of people upon whom it would reasonably be expected to have the most impact, many of whom were vulnerable and dependent on the department, and its minister, for their livelihood.” But Tudge responded: “I strongly reject the commission’s comments of the way I used the media and that I had abused my power in doing so. I reject that finding in the strongest terms. “At no stage did I seek to engage in a media strategy that would discourage legitimate criticism of this scheme.” He said the information released was “generally de-identified” and was released to “correct the public record”. 2.16pm Morrison says he trusted his department By Angus Thompson Former prime minister Scott Morrison also said in his statement there was no evidence before the commission that established he was responsible for government departments overseeing the robo-debt scheme “ceasing in their duties to ... [give] frank or candid advice to me regarding the need for legislative change”. He said the Department of Human Services was “simply authorised” to conduct further work on the policy before bringing back a final proposal that resolved any issues. Former prime minister Scott Morrison. with then-minister for home affairs Peter Dutton and then-minister for cities, urban infrastructure and population Alan Tudge. Credit: Dominic Lorrimer “This is normal policy and cabinet process. Policy proposals go through numerous stages of development, where issues are addressed before departments bring a final proposal to their minister for authorisation and submission to cabinet,” he said, adding officials must complete a due diligence checklist. He said the executive minute from bureaucrats in 2015 which highlighted the need for legislative change to implement the robo-debt scheme had been mischaracterised by the royal commission. “The executive minute did not have the significance which the commission seeks to attribute to it. The executive minute did not contain settled policy proposals, it contained options to pursue the development of incomplete proposals which had yet to be subjected to the rigorous cabinet processes and departmental due diligence assessment,” he said. “The findings which are adverse to me are based upon a fundamental misunderstanding of how government operates. The commission has suggested, contrary to decisions of the High Court and long-standing practice, that a minister cannot rely upon the advice of their own department. Such a proposition would make executive government completely unworkable.” Advertisement 2.09pm ‘Offensive and baseless’: Morrison lashes findings By Angus Thompson and Michaela Whitbourn Former prime minister Scott Morrison also said it was an “offensive and baseless” suggestion that he applied pressure to government officials to advance to robo-debt proposal. “There is also no evidence before the commission to the effect that I applied pressure to any person to push the [proposal] into the budget process either in a way that its implementation did not require legislation, or at all. “This is an offensive and baseless assertion.” Former prime minister Scott Morrison. Credit: Rhett Wyman He also said the proposal wasn’t initiated by the government but the public service. “It was initiated by departments before I became the minister for social services,” he said.“It was initiated against a background of an entirely understandable and therefore unextraordinary government policy, to identify possible savings within the Commonwealth’s largest portfolio in terms of expenditure and to prevent billions of dollars in overpayment of welfare benefits, in the interests of taxpayers.” Morrison also said he was given no departmental advice that identified risks about the hardships the scheme could cause people. “In my evidence to the commission I also noted that no concerns were raised by the Labor opposition or social services advocates regarding potential harmful impacts at the time the measure was approved and announced in the subsequent budget,” he said. Addressing the pressure royal commissioner Catherine Holmes, SC, said public servants were under to follow through on Morrison’s wishes, Morrison said: “I enjoyed a positive, respectful and professional relationship with public service officials at all times, and there is no evidence before the commission to the contrary.” ‘Strong welfare cop on the beat’ Morrison, then social services minister, had warned in January 2015 that “there does need to be a strong welfare cop on the beat” and “I will be doing that because I want to make sure this system helps the people who most need it”. Loading This was the backdrop against which the robo-debt automated debt assessment and recovery system was rolled out later that year on Morrison’s watch. The royal commission notes the importance of this language in its final report. “By 22 January 2015, Mr Morrison had clearly communicated to the public, the secretaries of DSS [Department of Social Services] and DHS [Department of Human Services], and deputy secretaries ... his intention to achieve budget savings through his portfolio,” the report said. “He had also conveyed the approach he intended to take to the portfolio generally, including through the language of a ‘crackdown’ on welfare cheats, ‘rorting’ the system, and the concept of himself as a ‘welfare cop’. “In doing so, Mr Morrison contributed to a certain atmosphere in which any proposals responsive to his request would be developed. The context was apt to encourage the development of proposals which reflected the approach and tone of his powerful language.” 2.01pm Morrison rejects findings against him By Angus Thompson Former prime minister Scott Morrison has issued a lengthy statement defending his involvement in the robo-debt scheme and expressing regret for the “unintended consequences” the crackdown had on welfare recipients and their families. “There are important lessons to be learned from the conduct of the scheme regarding harm minimisation and the use of digital technology to assist with the important task of welfare compliance,” he said in the statement issued this afternoon. Former prime minister Scott Morrison. Credit: Alex Ellinghausen However, he rejected the findings critical of his involvement as the former social services minister who submitted the proposal to cabinet in early 2015. “They are wrong, unsubstantiated and contradicted by clear documentary evidence presented to the Commission,” he said. “It is unfortunate that these findings fail to acknowledge the proper functioning of government and cabinet processes in the face of not only my evidence as a former prime minister, and cabinet minister for almost nine years, but also the evidence of other cabinet ministers.” Commissioner Catherine Holmes, SC, found that Morrison had allowed cabinet to be misled over the legality of the scheme, and didn’t follow up an inconsistency in 2015 after a stated need for legislative change to implement the robo-debt scheme disappeared from a policy document prepared by bureaucrats that he took to cabinet. “I acted in good faith and on clear and deliberate department advice that no legislation was required to introduce the scheme and presented comprehensive evidence to support this position,” he said. “I note the evidence before the commission confirmed that the responsible departments maintained the position that the scheme was lawful in subsequent submissions prepared for cabinet, after I had left the social services portfolio. “Any assertion to the contrary regarding the department’s position is completely wrong and without any evidentiary basis. I also note the evidence presented to and confirmed by departmental officials that the existence of departmental legal advice on this matter was inexplicably withheld from ministers.” 1.22pm Former minister says he is not named in sealed section By Paul Sakkal Former minister Stuart Robert has welcomed the robo-debt royal commission’s findings and says he is not caught up in the confidential sealed section of the royal commission’s report that makes criminal and civil referrals to Commonwealth authorities. “As the minister that worked hard to get the legal advice and close down [the robo-debt scheme] I welcome the RC report and its sensible recommendations,” he said in a written statement. Former minister Stuart Robert. Credit: Alex Ellinghausen “I have NOT received a notice of inclusion in the ‘sealed section’ and I understand they have all gone out.” The final report of robo-debt royal commissioner Catherine Holmes, SC, was published today. It contained a sealed chapter that was not viewable by the public and was sent to the authorities for further investigation. Holmes recommended that an additional sealed chapter of the report relating to the referral of individuals for civil action or criminal prosecution not be tabled in parliament “so as not to prejudice the conduct of any future civil action or criminal prosecution”. Robert was briefly responsible for robo-debt in mid to late 2019. The scheme was shut down in November 2019 after the Commonwealth settled a test case and agreed to orders declaring that key parts of the scheme were unlawful. The report said former Department of Human Services secretary Renee Leon took the first steps to end the scheme. “The commission rejects Mr Robert’s claim to have acted to end the Robodebt Scheme quite as promptly as he professes,” the report said. “Ms Leon was in fact the first to take steps for that purpose. There is no reason to suppose, however, that had Ms Leon not taken the step she did, the government’s announcement of the cessation of the practice would have been far behind.” Advertisement 1.08pm Top bureaucrat ‘failed to act’, report finds By Matthew Knott and Michaela Whitbourn Department of Human Services secretary Kathryn Campbell was criticised by the robo-debt royal commission for failing to act when confronted with information pointing to the unlawfulness of the debt recovery scheme. “Ms Campbell had been responsible for a department that had established, implemented and maintained an unlawful program,” the report said.

Campbell was subsequently promoted to head of the Department of Social Services and later the secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs, even as the scheme’s flaws became widely known. Campbell is currently serving as an adviser on the AUKUS pact in the Department of Defence, a role for which she is being paid an annual salary of $889,853. Income averaging referred to a process, subsequently found to be unlawful, under which Centrelink used data from the Australian Taxation Office to estimate the income of recipients of social security payments.

Here are the figures at a glance: $1.7 billion: amount of debt the robo-debt scheme raised against 526,000 welfare recipients. $971.4 million: how much the Commonwealth spent implementing, administering and winding back the scheme. $565.2 million: the net cost of the scheme.

Former Centrelink compliance officer Colleen Taylor told the robo-debt royal commission her agency was “stealing from its customers”. Former Centrelink compliance officer Colleen Taylor, who gave evidence at the royal commission, was singled out for praise. “Colleen Taylor, like many other unnamed valiant staff, deserve recognition for their strength and character. It is never easy to give bad news up the food chain in and organisation. Colleen Taylor deserves recognition for her bravery,” Shorten said. What was robo-debt? At the heart of the robo-debt scheme, which ran between July 2015 and November 2019 under the former Coalition government, was a practice known as income averaging that was subsequently found to be unlawful. It involved Centrelink using data from the Australian Taxation Office to estimate the income of recipients of social security payments. This automatic calculation created errors in many cases because it averaged out income into fortnightly periods, which may not have reflected the actual income received by recipients in that period. On the basis of those flawed figures, Centrelink concluded recipients had been overpaid their entitlements. Centrelink then sent a letter asking people to confirm or update their reported income, shifting the onus onto social security recipients to show they did not owe a debt. If the person did not respond within a specified time – perhaps because the letter was sent to an old address – robo-debt raised a debt against the person and imposed penalties if they were late in repaying it. In some cases, the Commonwealth seized funds from a person’s bank account or anticipated tax return to recover the debt. How Taylor spoke up The royal commission heard Taylor wrote to Department of Human Services secretary Kathryn Campbell in January 2017 following an all-staff email assuring workers there was no change to the way the department was calculating debts. Taylor told Campbell there had been a “dramatic change” between the previous manual assessment of payment and income discrepancies, and the new system that relied heavily on income averaging. Taylor said she told superiors “you just can’t do this to people” over the flawed debt calculation method she said effectively double-counted income. She told the hearing one of her colleagues quit over the scheme while others discussed how they could stop it. “There was a lot of discussion of just how unfair it was, and sympathy for the information that was out there in the media,” Taylor told the commission.

Real Valladolid prospect Ivan Fresneda , 18, has been a long-term target for the Gunners. 1 Barcelona are closing in on the transfer signing of Ivan Fresneda Credit: Getty Arsenal’s scouts have highly recommended Fresneda, even though he is still a relative rookie who has made just 26 senior appearances for Valladolid after being released by Real Madrid’s youth academy as a 14-year-old. Mikel Arteta was keen on the right-back during the January transfer window when he was looking to strengthen his squad for the title run-in. But any hopes of a deal were scuppered when Valladolid slapped a £35million price-tag on the highly-regarded Spanish youth international. It is now thought that the LaLiga side could be ready to sell for just half, or even less, of that original valuation, which could open the door for Arsenal to make a formal offer. We reported how Borussia Dortmund were also keen on Fresneda . However, now it appears that both clubs are set to be pipped by Barcelona , according to Marca . They have claimed that Barca’s sporting director Deco met with Fresneda’s agent on Thursday to discuss a transfer and the pair were even pictured together. Nou Camp boss Xavi has already revealed that he hopes to bring in a new right-back during the summer window.

Yonhap Park Eun-seon, Korea\'s oldest forward for the upcoming FIFA Women\'s World Cup, said Friday she was high on the future of her youngest teammate, 16-year-old forward Casey Phair. Phair, born to an American father and a Korean mother in the United States, broke Park\'s record as the youngest player to make a World Cup squad for Korea. Park made her World Cup debut at 16 years and nine months in 2003, and Phair just turned 16 on June 29. When unveiling the roster Tuesday, head coach Colin Bell said he liked Phair\'s physicality and her ability to finish with both feet. Park, who had a front-row seat to Phair during training camp for the past three or so weeks, said she couldn\'t agree with Bell more. Park Eun-seon, forward on the Korean women\'s national football team, speaks during a press conference at the National Football Center in Paju, Friday. Yonhap \"The coach selected Phair because she is good enough to be on the team. Now that I\'ve trained with her, I can tell you she is really talented, and I expect big things out of her in the future,\" Park said at a press conference at the National Football Center in Paju, some 40 kilometers northwest of Seoul. Korea will play Haiti at 5 p.m. Saturday in Seoul as their final tuneup match before the World Cup kicks off later this month in Australia and New Zealand. \"I think she will put on a good performance at the World Cup,\" Park added. \"When I played at my first World Cup, I was pretty young too. Even though we didn\'t play well, I had a lot of fun just following the lead of my older teammates.\" Park also played at the 2015 World Cup but didn\'t make the 2019 team. Now at 36, Park will be playing in her third and likely final World Cup. \"I am grateful for this opportunity to play at another World Cup. I am really looking forward to it,\" Park said. \"The coach has been taking great care of me, and I want to reward him for having so much trust in me.\" Korean forward Park Eun-seon, right, having a conversation with her teammates while participating in a training session for the FIFA Women\'s World Cup at the National Football Center in Paju, Wednesday.

In relation to grammar, subordination joins two clauses of unequal grammatical status. The words used to weaken and subordinate a clause to another are called subordinators or subordinating conjunctions. When a subordinator is used before a clause, such a clause becomes unable to make sense on its own unless it is used in the company of another clause. It should be added that the essence of understanding coordination and subordination, as grammatical features, is to be able to vary one’s sentences in order to avoid monotonous and pedestrian sentences in speech or writing. Subordinate clauses may either come first in a sentence or be placed after the main clause. When the subordinate clause comes first in a sentence, it is separated by a comma; but when it comes after the main clause, the main clause is not separated by a comma: When he is in the class, he does not talk to anyone (right). He does not talk to anyone when he is in the class (right). He does not talk to anyone, when he is in the class (wrong punctuation). Having said that, the rest of this treatise will discuss the different kinds of subordination, list the functions of the subordinators and clarify basic errors associated with the use of subordinators. A discussion on the types of subordination will necessitate explaining the different clause types. Clauses can be classified in two major ways: finiteness and dependency. Finiteness splits into finite and non-finite clauses. A finite clause must have a finite verb which marks tense in the verb and makes it agree with a subject. A finite clause is an equivalent of a simple sentence and can stand on its own to make meaning. Examples are as follows: Grammar is fun. English is a global language. A non-finite clause, by comparison, has a non-finite verb, and it functions as a subordinate clause. Non-finite clauses are generated through the three forms of non-finite verbs: -ing inflected verbs, as in: Looking straight into her eyes, Jide proclaimed his love for his girlfriend. Expecting trouble, the policemen took adequate precautions. -en inflected verbs, as in: Unbeaten throughout the season, Chelsea became the pride of England. To-infinitive, as in: To tell you the truth, I am not ready for this conversation. The dependency classification splits clauses into independent and dependent clauses. An independent clause makes sense on its own without the support of another clause. It is an equivalent of a simple sentence and the same as a finite clause: She is angry. Her friends seem naughty. The dependent clause adds to the meaning of an independent clause and cannot make a meaning on its own. Dependent clauses are actually independent clauses which have subordinators in front of them: Because she was angry (she left the room). When her friends seem naughty (she acts like a mature person). Subordinators show different functions such as: Time (I saw her WHEN I came.) Place (She lives in Lagos WHERE everyone is busy.) Reason (I left the venue BECAUSE I was tired.) Condition (You will see him IF you come early.) CONCESSION (ALTHOUGH he teaches English so well, he hasn’t been to England.) Some clarifications should be made with the use of subordinators. First, note that “despite” and “in spite of” show concession, but the former is a single word while the latter is a compound word: In spite of the number of people who applied, only few persons were called for an interview (standard). Despite the number of people who applied, only few persons were called for an interview (standard). Inspite of the number of people who applied, only few persons were called for an interview (non-standard). Next, when “although” starts a sentence, it is not usually followed by the comma, as in: Although, Peter arrived on time, he didn’t see John until 6 p.m. (poor punctuation). Although Peter arrived on time, he didn’t see John until 6 p.m. (excellent punctuation). What is more, refrain from using the subordinating conjunction “although” and the coordinating conjunction “but” in the same sentence thus: Although Peter arrived on time, but he didn’t see John until 6 p.m. (non-standard). Although Peter arrived on time, he didn’t see John until 6 p.m. (standard). Peter arrived on time, but he didn’t see John until 6 p.m. (standard). Read also: Coordination in English Moving on, it should be mentioned that there are other compound subordinators which consist of more than one item. They are mainly formed with “that”, and their examples include: so that, in order that, such that, and now that. Listen attentively so that you can get the point. They travelled abroad in order that their kids may get the best of exposure. Now that you are ready, you can get an apartment for yourself. He was angry such that no one could appeal to him. Lastly, there are correlative subordinators. The use of one necessitates the use of the other. These subordinators are: if… then, as… so, so… that. Their usages are given in the example sentences below: If he is truly rich, then he should help his wife. As they were preparing to come see him so was he planning to visit them. So busy was my day that I could not eat till 2 p.m. Subordination is integral to spoken and written contexts of language use, as there would always be the need to vary the weight of propositions. This piece is an account of the subordinating elements in the English language, and a careful perusal will stand you in good stead as a user of English.', NULL, NULL, 'https://businessday.ng/columnist/article/subordination-in-english/', '2023-07-07 01:34:12', 'nigeria', NULL, '2023-07-07 07:47:34', '2023-07-07 07:47:34', 2, 'Columnists;English grammar', NULL, 0),

According to the International Trade Centre, China is the world\'s largest exporter and importer of manufactured goods. Inquiry Before Buying @ https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Enquiry_Before_BuyingNew.asp?id=194541294 The available labor has resulted in the growth of several labor-intensive industries, such as clothing, textiles, footwear, furniture, plastic products, bags, and toys. However, the aging population has created a labor shortage, leading to a wage rise. This is compelling companies to adopt automation and collaborative robots to reduce costs. With increasing labor costs, China is expected to increase investments in automation further to maintain its cost advantage in production. As a result, China\'s collaborative robot (cobot) market will likely remain dominant during the forecast period. China is moving from labor-intensive simple industries toward manufacturing high-tech goods, such as semiconductors, through its Made in China 2025 policy. According to the International Organization of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers (OICA), China is the largest manufacturer of commercial vehicles. Therefore, the demand for collaborative robots in the electronics and automotive industries is expected to be high in China. According to the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation, China provides higher subsidies for robot adoption than any other nation and is expected to lead the world with the highest number of collaborative robots (cobots) as a share of its industrial workers in the future. In China, collaborative robots are expected to help the manufacturing industry stay competitive during economic uncertainties. China is pioneering both the adoption and development of cobots to minimize this risk. Major firms in the electronics industry, such as ZTE (China) and Foxconn (China), are purchasing collaborative robots. China\'s significant foreign direct investment (FDI) provides the required infrastructure environment for field testing cobots. SMEs account for most of the business entities in China; their requirement for greater operational flexibility presents a growing opportunity for the deployment of cobots. Major cobot manufacturers in China include AUBO (Beijing) Robotics Technology Co., Ltd (China), Elephant Robotics (China), Han\'s Robot (China), and Siasun Robot & Automation Co. Ltd. (South Korea). These companies are expected to dominate the collaborative robot market in the coming years.

However, the aging population has created a labor shortage in recent years, leading to a wage rise. This is compelling companies to adopt automation and industrial robots to reduce costs. china is moving from labor-intensive simple industries toward high-tech manufacturing goods, such as semiconductors, through its Made in China 2025 policy. With Chinese telecommunication equipment giant Huawei being placed on the US blocklist, China aimed to produce 40% of the semiconductors it uses by 2021 and 70% by 2025. In May 2019, the Chinese government announced tax breaks for homegrown semiconductor companies; Xiaomi and Alibaba, these companies have already begun working on their AI processor. Inquiry Before Buying @ https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Enquiry_Before_BuyingNew.asp?id=643 According to the International Organization of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers (OICA), China is the largest manufacturer of commercial vehicles. Therefore, the demand for industrial robots in the electronics and automotive industries is expected to be high. According to the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation, China provides higher subsidies for robot adoption than any other nation and is expected to lead the world in the number of industrial robots used across the industry. Government initiatives and regulations to introduce fuel-efficient cars to reduce emissions and the carbon footprint present an opportunity for an industrial robotics market recovery. The Chinese government has ambitious plans for the country\'s robotics industry. It has listed the robotics industry and AI and automation as one the priority sectors for high-end development to push forward the transformation of the manufacturing industry. China is also one of the largest manufacturers and assemblers of electronics; however, a slump in demand for smartphones has affected the need for automation in the sector. With increasing labor costs, China is expected to increase investments in automation further to maintain its cost advantage in production. As a result, China\'s industrial robotics market will remain dominant during the forecast period.

Wireless headphones eliminate the hassle of constantly untangling headphones from their charging case. There is nothing else out there quite like Inductivv\'s methodology. Those who haven\'t heard the headphones in action may be skeptical of their claims of incredible performance and superior sound quality. Nonetheless, Inductivv has been highly rated by its users. The vast majority of current listeners acknowledge they were skeptical of the headphones\' innovation at first. However, they quickly realized that the headphones had fantastic sound quality and could be worn for hours on end without causing any discomfort or irritation. Exactly How Do Inductivv Headphones Work? Inductivv uses bone conduction rather than the more common air conduction found in headphones. Yes, it is as simple as it appears. With induction, sound waves are redirected from the eardrum to the cochlea by way of the skeleton. Two pads ensure your comfort while using the Inductivv headset. Connecting your headphones to these pads will cause vibrations to be transmitted to your ears. The temporal bones of the ear are responsible for transmitting sound to the hearing organ, the cochlea. By keeping the ear free and open, it ensures that you never lose track of your surroundings. So, while you\'re out on a run, you can be exposed to the sounds of passing vehicles, cyclists, and fellow runners. When jogging through restricted areas, this may be necessary for safety reasons. Inductivv is a comfortable and secure option for wearing over the ear. This makes it suitable for continuous use and physical activity. Exercises like running and going to the gym present a minimal risk of injury. It\'s a Bluetooth headphone that\'s super simple to use and has a wide range. One simple button controls everything from taking and rejecting calls to powering off the headphones and pausing the music. http://bit.ly/Inductivv_Bone_Induction_Official_Website_Click_Here_To_Buy Inductivv Bone Conduction Headphones: Features & Specs ➡️USB Port: On the left anchor without the power button and LED indicator light.

Paws for Purple Hearts is a non-profit organization that relies on the generosity of donors and volunteers. Background: Paws for Purple Hearts (PPH) is a fully approved 501(c)(3) that participates in the Combined Federal Campaign (#43093). PPH started as a Service Dog Training Canine Assisted Therapy pilot program at the Bergin University of Canine Studies in Rohnert Park, California.

As the demand for other services such as those described in section one above grew, PPH added to its capability set. This year, thanks to the generous contributions of our donors and volunteers, PPH is establishing new facilities in San Diego, San Antonio, and is ramping up operations in the Washington, DC Metro area, and in the San Francisco Bay Area. Services Paws for Purple Hearts provides: a. Service Dog Training Canine Assisted Therapy.

Interacting with our puppies and dogs under the caring supervision of our Bergin educated dog trainers can help reduce the severity of PTSD, TBI, and MST symptoms. b. Specialist Canine Assisted Therapy Dog. We provide a therapy dog to a host organization-selected specialist care provider there, for example a psychologist, psychiatrist or other similar therapist. This specialist utilizes the dog in the course of their work to provide therapeutic benefit to patients that come to his/her office for appointments, or while making the rounds in a clinical setting. This individual is responsible for the routine care of the dog, while we remain available as \"tech support\" for veterinary or other issues requiring deeper dog handling expertise. We train the specialist first to equip them with the tools they need to maximize effectiveness. c. Facility Dog. In this program, one of our trained dogs roams a facility, providing a friendly face to welcome patients, their families and staff to help support a positive and more home-like atmosphere. Each Facility Dog is assigned to a contact person at the host facility who manages daily activities and carries out routine dog care (e.g., feeding, walks, waste removal), while our staff remains available to provide further support when needed, including veterinary care. d. Service Dog. We pair meticulously bred, lovingly raised, and thoroughly trained service dogs with their ideal Warrior recipients using Bergin University\'s scientifically rigorous matching methodology. Warrior and service dog meet during Training Camp where they learn to live and work together while forming a lifelong bond. Our disciplined process ensures a successful, lasting, and effective partnership for each Warrior and service dog pair. -- This release was published on openPR.

All of a sudden, hot people need to find a personality. Let’s go through some of the highlights and chat about exactly what’s happening as we witness the dawn of this massive new social media app. What is Threads? Threads is a product of the tech company Meta, which is owned by . It was essentially created to be an alternative to Twitter, an app recently bought by . Famously, Musk has driven Twitter into the ground both financially and culturally. Twitter is now of what Musk initially paid for it and on top of that Musk has , enacted a bizarre and most recently limited the . Enter, Threads. A simple way to consume text-based content, minus the chaotic baggage of Twitter. Over people have now joined Threads and we won’t lie, it doesn’t feel nearly as hellish, or as buggy as its closest competitor. What’s on the Threads app? Currently, it’s pretty barebones in terms of features. It’s literally just a feed of “Threads” that the early adopters of the platform have published. A mixture of influencers, celebs, comedians and companies. Unlike Meta’s other apps, Facebook and Instagram, there aren’t any advertisements on Threads. This makes it feel like you’re seeing things that you organically want to see. It probably won’t be this way for long as Meta scurries to monetise the platform but hey, let’s enjoy it while it lasts. There’s also no “explore” function so you can’t see what’s “trending” in your geographical area or globally. Again, this will probably be added soon but Meta likely wanted to avoid doing too much on day one and risk launching a bug-ridden app. Should I download Threads? Totally up to you. If you already have an Instagram account, Meta has made it simple to set up a Threads account. In fact, you can make a Threads account if you already have an Instagram account. You can choose to import your profile pic, your bio and even your contact list over from Instagram, making for a smooth and endorphin-filled transition as you rapidly gain followers. There have been a few alarm bells being run over and Meta has a very long . So, while it’s not , it’s not unexpected. Another thing to take into account is that your Threads account is tied to your Instagram account. This means you won’t be able to delete your Threads account without deleting your Instagram. Food for thought… Show me some funny Threads, ya dogs Okay FINE. Here’s a selection we’ve procured while scrolling at our desks all day at “work”. So there you have it. Happy Threading.

Since then, he has continued to shake the establishment with a string of night-time press statements which heralded the firing of his central-bank governor, the top brass of the army and the heads of several key government agencies, including the police, the customs service and the financial-crimes commission. His biggest scalp was that of the central banker, Godwin Emefiele, whom the secret police detained—so far without charge—on June 9th. Mr Tinubu explained that “the financial system [had been] rotten” under the supervision of Mr Emefiele, who had held the job for the past nine years. Many Nigerians blame Mr Emefiele for Nigeria’s economic woes. Since he took office Nigeria has twice fallen into recession. Annual inflation recently hit 22%, the highest for 18 years. The central bank has been accused of profligacy by lending the government $53bn in recent years. Last year debt servicing alone chewed up a grim 96% of government revenues. Moreover, some of the ousted governor’s other policies were abject failures, such as his sudden plan to redesign some banknotes and scrap the old ones, leading to severe shortages of cash needed by Nigerians for day-to-day living. He was also blamed for overseeing Nigeria’s multiple foreign-exchange rates, which boosted the black market and deterred foreign trade. Mr Tinubu has ordered the immediate reunification of the rates. Their confusing multiplicity contributed to the dramatic decline of foreign direct investment in Nigeria in the past few years. Whether Mr Emefiele’s arrest is lawful is another matter. Nigeria’s government has often taken a shoot-first-ask-questions-later approach to such matters. A court is expected to determine the constitutionality of the detention by July 13th. Mr Emefiele’s friends say he is an innocent man being scapegoated. Mr Tinubu’s speedy appointments on the security side are intended to help curb terrorism in the country’s northeast and the scourge of kidnapping in the northwest, as well as violence elsewhere. sbm, an intelligence outfit based in Lagos, the commercial capital, estimates that between July 2021 and June 2022, 3,420 people, including hundreds of schoolchildren, were kidnapped. Mr Tinubu has appointed Nuhu Ribadu, an ex-policeman who once headed the financial-crimes commission, as his new security adviser. Busy Mr Tinubu has evidently managed to find time to attend to less pressing matters. He has renamed no fewer than 15 airports dotted around the country to honour notable Nigerians with local connections, including Muhammadu Buhari, his dozier predecessor. The main airport in Lagos, where Mr Tinubu made his reputation as a punchy governor, is still named after a previous president, General Murtala Muhammed, who was assassinated in 1976. Nigerians are hoping for livelier yet safer leadership under their new man.

The footage is then tweaked in post-production by visual effects artists who replace the coloured filler with any background image or footage.

GSK2140944 (Gepotidacin) Drug Summary GSK2140944, also known as Gepotidacin, is a novel antibiotic being developed by GSK for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (uUTI). It belongs to a new class of antibiotics that was first discovered at GSK in 2007. Gepotidacin has a unique \"dual targeting\" mechanism of action (MOA) and is administered orally. Unlike currently approved antibiotics, Gepotidacin selectively interacts with two specific bacterial enzymes, DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV (both type II topoisomerases), which play a crucial role in bacterial replication. This MOA enables Gepotidacin to effectively combat bacteria that have developed resistance to other antibiotics, including fluoroquinolones. GSK has a long history of antibiotic research spanning over 45 years. Despite the reduction in the number of large pharmaceutical companies involved in this field, GSK maintains a dedicated research team focused on discovering new medicines to combat bacterial infections. Gepotidacin (GSK2140944) is the company\'s lead topoisomerase inhibitor, designed to address various indications, including uUTI. The development of this drug has been conducted in collaboration with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) and the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA). Currently, Gepotidacin (GSK2140944) is in the Phase III stage of development. Prior to this, it successfully completed a Phase II clinical study. The drug is currently being evaluated in two Phase III clinical trials, which are randomized, multicenter, double-blind studies involving adolescent and adult females. These trials aim to compare the efficacy and safety of Gepotidacin to nitrofurantoin in the treatment of uUTI, specifically acute cystitis.

The potential hackers reportedly had a window of approximately three hours to block the exploit. The first indication of the exploit was a small transfer made on the Binance chain. The alleged hackers then began exploiting the ETH chain. The scale of the potential hack is enormous, with the theft amounting to around $126 million. As the crypto community awaits further updates, the incident serves as a stark reminder of the potential vulnerabilities in the system. It underscores the need for robust security measures and the importance of constant vigilance in the rapidly evolving world of cryptocurrency.

Current finds on the @MultichainOrg hack: It appears that activity has stopped. However, with multiple bridges all being drained, this looks more like a hack or rugpull and less like a migration. Please do not use and revoke all permission related to Multichain. Timeline:… https://t.co/EFeo4DH3yV — SlowMist (@SlowMist_Team) July 7, 2023 Blockchain security firm SlowMist commented, “The activity seems to have ceased. However, considering multiple bridges have been drained, it appears more like a hack or a rugpull rather than a migration.” SlowMist pointed out the initial suspicious transaction, which occurred at 4:21 pm UTC, where a mere $2 in USDC was withdrawn from the Multichain Fantom bridge. Two hours following this, the alleged hacker extracted $31 million WBTC, and an hour later, began draining the Multichain Moonriver bridge and the Multichain Dogechain bridge. Blockchain security firm Certik, which had audited Multichain twice without identifying any critical issues with its codebase, stated, “This exploit seems to be the consequence of a private key compromise, and as such, it falls outside the purview of the audits we conducted.” Trading without Tradingview is like surfing without waves.

(1875, 'What-Threads-is-missing-as-it-tears-down-Twitter', 'What Threads is missing as it tears down Twitter', 'Millions have signed up for Meta’s Twitter alternative, but it’s clear Threads will need to change a lot over the coming months.', 'Meta’s Twitter alternative Threads has got off to a momentous start, partly because it’s tied to Instagram with its billions of subscribers, and partly because it’s simply not Twitter . But once the excitement fades, you may notice Threads is a surprisingly bare-bones app. It’s easy to see how some of the missing elements will be included down the line, such as a web version of the service (it already works kind of, it just needs a proper interface) and direct messages (Meta will just use Messenger). Threads has has a big debut with millions of sign-ups, but Meta has a lot of work to do. But there are other missing pieces that are a bit more complicated. For starters, a clearer policy on verification (currently you get the blue tick if you have it on Instagram, which is to show you’re a notable figure or you pay for Meta Verified) would help. Home feed options The main feed of Threads currently only has one flavour; an algorithmic mix of people you follow, suggested posts and content from users and conversations currently getting the most engagement. This makes sense for a brand-new app. Meta wants to make it feel like a party that’s already jumping, not a blank slate you have to fill in yourself. But what happens once people get settled? It’s tiring to see a bunch of stuff you have no interest in, but suggestions are vital to engagement and that feeling of a vibrant community. On Instagram, posts from follows are mixed liberally with ads and suggested content, whereas Twitter and TikTok have two separate feeds; one that focuses on follows and one on suggestions. A lot will come down to Meta’s ability to pick suggestions that are legitimately interesting to each user, which is apparently extremely difficult if Twitter and Facebook’s current efforts are anything to go by. An ideal implementation would also keep users abreast of the most important or interesting events happening in real time, if they chose, like Twitter was able to with Trends at the height of its relevance. Search Threads also needs to work on that little magnifying glass. Currently, you’re able to search for users to follow, but not topics, keywords, phrases or hashtags. This might seem like something that should be there from day one but, as above, it’s probably like this to maintain the illusion of activity. If you were able to search for your specific interests, you might see nobody on Threads is talking about it. Loading Once the topics on the service start extending beyond awkward introductions, grabs for followers and “now all my Insta fans are going to see the real me in goblin mode LOL”, Meta will have to make some philosophical decisions about how it treats search. All current platforms seem to use it as an opportunity to put more specific follow suggestions in your face, rather than to helpfully surface information. Clicking the magnifying glass on Instagram currently gives you a wall of “you might like” posts. Twitter promotes “trends” that are frequently nonsensical strings of words that have just happened to appear next to each other more often than usual, while searches for any legitimately trending terms inevitably lead to screens of crypto scams. Allowing users to feel like they can find conversations, rather than just content to consume or people to follow, will be key. Accessibility and user experience Surprisingly, Threads has launched without the ability to add custom alt text to images or custom captions to video, which are available in other Meta apps. This is an inexcusable omission that not only makes the app inaccessible to people with various disabilities, but makes me wonder if the whole service was launched a lot sooner than its developers had expected. The app can deliver AI descriptions and captions, but that’s not good enough. Loading There are also no settings for font size, contrast, colours, themes or other standard accessibility features, though Meta has made changes in the first 24 hours that allow Threads to follow certain settings you’ve set on your phone at a device level. Aside from that, there’s also the way Meta has tied Threads to Instagram. It does make sense if your goal is to get as many people using as possible, make sure they have friends built in and make sure nobody takes the handle of already-established brands and influencers. But it also makes the app out of bounds for people who don’t want Instagram, and prevents Threads users from deleting their account without also nuking their Insta. That’s not nice.

In the near future, gamers will see the project go cross chain, engage with stunning new art, and witness the game hub get a shiny new revamp. Since the NFT market got a little shaky, some NFT gaming companies have remained in perpetual development. Seemingly waiting for the opportune moment to launch their titles while the going is hot, and crypto is once again the talk of the town. Not Aurory however, which, come rain or shine has continued soldiering on with its flagship platform, regardless of the market climate, or the mad rumblings of crypto Twitter. Through this constant drive to innovate and engage, Aurory has risen as a powerhouse in NFT gaming. One that effectively now stands on its own merit and is not held up by the pillars of market volatility. So, it’s not unexpected then, that while traditional NFT projects like Azuki are up in flames , Aurory has unveiled a series of magnificent updates. Aurory to Travel Beyond its Familiar Solana Surroundings Part of Aurory’s intriguing round of platform enhancements will see it travel beyond the confines of its Solana home. So far, the team has remained tight lipped with regards to the specific network it will engage with. However, wheat we do know is it will exist on the Ethereum Virtual Machine, and launch some time in July. What’s more, Aurory has also revealed that it will also cross the threshold of traditional gaming by merging with some legacy Web2 platforms. Effectively, broadening its reach to encompass the many facets of the video gaming community. In addition to these major milestones, the Aurory team has announced a major upgrade to its NFT artwork, with an option for holders to upgrade their character. While a new game hub and customization feature for ‘non-Aurorians’ is also on the cards. Want more?

LUKSO is a trailblazing EVM blockchain, rooted in the Casper PoS architecture, set to transform the interaction between brands, creators, and users within blockchain technology in the emerging Creative Economy. It’s the brainchild of Fabian Vogelsteller and Marjorie Hernandez, who are recognized innovators in their respective fields. Fabian Vogelsteller, a key contributor to Ethereum as a lead DApp developer, is renowned for authoring both ERC20 and web3.js, the pivotal elements of contemporary DeFi and NFT protocols. Marjorie Hernandez, an expert in innovation and product development, was instrumental in founding and managing EY’s Digital Innovation Lab in Berlin. LUKSO Standards Proposals (LSPs): The Foundation of LUKSO Ecosystem The initial LUKSO Standards Proposals (LSPs) form the structural basis of the LUKSO ecosystem. They strive to enhance functionality and ease-of-use within the blockchain ecosystem while standardizing facets like identity, asset depiction, and smart contract transactions. The fundamental LSPs are highly adaptable, paving the way for a myriad of new applications and simplifying both developer and user experiences. These standards are ‘neutral,’ indicating their broad-based application that fosters the emergence of yet unconceived use cases. Universal Profiles: Revolutionizing Digital Identity Universal Profiles are interoperable blockchain-based identities that enable verifiable identities in the digital realm. These profiles offer a universal login system that eliminates the need for traditional usernames and passwords, providing full control over all your virtual assets and identity. They streamline the onboarding process to Web3 for users, brands, and creators, enhancing accessibility, security, and functionality. LSP6 Key Manager and Advanced Access The LSP6 Key Manager enables the addition of varied access levels, inclusive of dApp access and other environments. Universal Profiles enhance on-chain security for users, enabling users to react to received assets/tokens, such as rejecting transfers, via the LSP1 Universal Receiver. Facilitating Creative Economies with Identifiable Digital Assets and NFTs Universal profiles facilitate economic and verifiable interactions, serving as the cornerstone for the new creative economies. The LSP8 Identifiable Digital Asset and LSP7 Digital Asset NFT allow for highly extensible and smart contract-readable token metadata inputs. These metadata inputs can evolve over time, enabling post-minting modification of NFTs. On LUKSO, NFTs and tokens can have multiple creators and inform receivers of assets, making complex smart contract automation possible. LSP6 Key Manager and the Future of Transaction Relay Services Co-founder Fabian Vogelsteller proposed the ERC725 smart contract standard in 2017 to establish a blockchain-based account system. The LSP6 Key Manager enables relay transactions, allowing third parties to cover a user’s transaction fees (GAS). Recommended posts PEPE Coin Price to Reach $5 in the Next Seven Days? To the article Universal Profiles can work with any future transaction relay service. As relay services are backend systems executing user transactions, users don’t need initial funds to use their Universal Profiles. LUKSO plans to support early adopters by providing a public relay service, simplifying interactions with the LUKSO blockchain. ERC725 Standard: The Foundation of Multiple LSPs The ERC725 standard serves as the foundation for any entity requiring public, verifiable storage of its information, as well as executing arbitrary smart contracts. This standard underpins numerous LSPs, enhancing the functionality of tokens, NFTs, and forming the core standard of Universal Profiles. LUKSO’s Sustainable Future: Embracing Proof of Stake LUKSO operates on a Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchain model, which is markedly more energy-efficient than Proof of Work (PoW) models, utilizing 99% less energy as it eliminates the need for competitive hash generation to reach consensus on the latest canonical block head. Why Add LUKSO to MetaMask? As a blockchain dedicated to digital lifestyles and economies, LUKSO offers a unique environment for creators, consumers, and developers. Adding it to MetaMask not only extends your reach within the blockchain sphere, it also enhances your ability to interact with various digital assets.

However, it requires additional catalysts to sustain its upward momentum. Last month, Bitcoin’s rally above the crucial $30,000 level was driven by the news of BlackRock and other companies applying for spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This development raised expectations of increased participation from retail and institutional investors in the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin managed to surpass the $31,000 mark, reaching its highest level in 13 months. However, the cryptocurrency later hit a reversal. While Bitcoin is struggling with short-term resistance, Ethereum is experiencing a bearish divergence. According to a new video by Crypto World, Bitcoin, as of the time of writing, is still within a larger multi-month bullish trend. However, a confirmed breakout above a significant resistance level of around $31,000 is required to validate the bullish momentum. To confirm a breakout above $31,000, a weekly candle close above this level is needed. If this occurs, the next target based on Fibonacci extensions would be around $37,000. However, he said that BTC is currently facing rejection from a resistance level near $31,300. Multiple rejections in the past two weeks suggest that this level is significant. Additionally, an area between $30,800 and $31,000 may also act as short-term resistance based on previous highs. On the support side, the range between $29,900 and $30,100 is important, with $30,000 being a critical level. Talking about Ethereum, he said that it is still within a larger multi-month bullish trend. Higher lows and higher highs on the larger time frames indicate the ongoing bullish momentum.

Here’s a closer look at the unfolding story: Powell a “Mastermind Hacker” or “Innocent Victim”?  …', 'A high-profile cryptocurrency figure finds himself at the center of a gripping investigation as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) conducts a search of the Los Angeles home belonging to Jesse Powell, the founder of Kraken, a renowned crypto exchange. Here’s a closer look at the unfolding story: The FBI is delving into allegations that Powell hacked and cyber-stalked Verge Center for the Arts, a nonprofit organization that he himself founded. The focus of the investigation centers around claims that Powell interfered with the organization’s computer accounts, effectively blocking access to crucial emails and other communications. Evidently during the search of Powell’s residence in the affluent Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles, law enforcement authorities seized various electronic devices. However, no criminal charges have been filed against Powell at this time, the search signals the seriousness of the investigation and the potential ramifications for the crypto entrepreneur. Powell’s attorney, Brandon Fox, has confirmed that his client is under investigation by federal prosecutors in Northern California. However, Fox emphasized that the probe is specifically related to the allegations made by Verge Center for the Arts and does not pertain to Powell’s professional endeavors within the cryptocurrency industry. Fox firmly asserted Powell’s innocence, stating that he “did nothing wrong.” Kraken, the cryptocurrency exchange founded by Powell, sought to distance itself from the investigation, asserting that it is solely focused on the allegations involving Verge Center for the Arts and does not affect the company. Kraken remains one of the major players in the crypto exchange space, but the outcome of the investigation could have implications for the exchange’s reputation and future prospects. Notably, the entire investigation into Powell’s activities adds to the growing legal scrutiny surrounding Kraken. So far the exchange has faced previous allegations, including claims made in a wrongful termination lawsuit filed against the company in 2019. While the lawsuit was settled in 2021, it accused Kraken of earning revenue from accounts in countries under U.S. sanctions and alleged missing customer deposits. This incident comes amidst a period of increased regulatory scrutiny for cryptocurrency exchanges. Kraken’s competitors, including FTX, Coinbase, and Binance, have also faced significant regulatory challenges. The actions taken by authorities highlight their determination to ensure compliance and tackle potential misconduct within the industry. As the investigation unfolds, the crypto community watches with anticipation to see how this development will impact both Jesse Powell’s future and the broader landscape of the cryptocurrency exchange sector.', NULL, NULL, 'https://coinpedia.org/news/former-kraken-ceo-jesse-powells-home-raided-by-fbi-in-high-stakes-investigation/', '2023-07-06 23:41:02', 'united states of america', NULL, '2023-07-07 08:18:42', '2023-07-07 08:18:42', 2, 'News;Crypto news', NULL, 0);

More UK savers should stash money away in shares, think-tank says We speak to two readers to get their stance on the debate By Jane Denton For Thisismoney Published: 01:00 EDT, 7 July 2023 | Updated: 01:00 EDT, 7 July 2023 e-mail View comments Britons are ploughing too much money into cash savings and would be better off opting for potentially more lucrative returns elsewhere, an influential think tank suggests. Research from the Centre for Policy Studies reveals UK retail investors - or non-professionals - control 21 per cent of the country\'s assets under management, the lowest percentage in Europe. The figure compares unfavourably with France, Germany, Italy and Spain, where retail investors control 28, 30, 34 and 84 per cent of their country\'s market, respectively. The CPS warned: \'Under normal circumstances, this neglect of the stock market would be bad for the UK, its citizens and its growth prospects. \'But in the current inflationary environment, the huge amount of savings left in cash is positively disastrous.\' Too much? Britons plough too much money into cash savings rather than shares, a think-tank claims The UK also has a far lower percentage of household financial assets in listed shares, according to the research. It further warned that the percentage of UK equities owned by Britons has been \'falling consistently for decades\' amid a push for institutional over retail investors. The percentage of UK equities owned by Britons now stands at just 12 per cent, compared to over 50 per cent in the 1960s. There is currently £1.8trillion worth of cash in savings accounts across the UK. This, the CPS said, is roughly equivalent to the entire market capitalisation of the FTSE 100, and approximately £300million in National Savings and Investments accounts.

Share this article Share HOW THIS IS MONEY CAN HELP How to choose the best (and cheapest) stocks and shares Isa Various asset classes perform differently over different time periods \'The value of those savings is currently being hammered by inflation\', the think-tank said. Nick King, a research fellow at the Centre for Policy Studies, added: \'The UK’s overly cautious attitude to risk and high regulatory barriers to investing are putting millions of people off becoming shareholders. \'This means those who save in cash are seeing its value eroded thanks to inflation, falling ever further behind the more-affluent and better-advised.\' Saving in bank accounts feels almost risk free Helen Aitchison thinks cash savings are less risky than shares Helen Aitchison, 42, lives in Newcastle with her partner, Paul, 43. She is a director of Write on the Tyne and is on the board of trustees of Age UK Tyneside. She\'s also an author and has published two books, The Dinner Club and The Life and Love (Attempts) of Kitty Cook . Helen prefers cash savings over investing in shares. She has two savings accounts with her existing bank. She likes the fact she can move her money around quickly if needed and thinks cash savers are less risky. Helen said: \'The interest rate on one of our savings accounts is 2.30 per cent and you can withdraw the money at any time – it isn’t locked in. This is a great way to save for me, personally. It means I have cash set aside if I need it, earning a little interest which does add up, over the year.\' She claims to be a \'little\' worried about inflation eroding her savings. She told This is Money: \'Saving in bank accounts feels almost risk free, whereas shares can rise and fall. \'Saying this, investing in shares is not something I have thought of much. Shares aren’t visibly advertised, in my experience, and therefore, I don’t feel many people have knowledge of the opportunities and processes. \'The risk is that you could lose money or not make any profit would be the main concern to me. There doesn’t feel to be the security of banking with share investment. Also the possible time investment of checking, worrying, comparing to other shares available feels like it could add stress and time that I haven’t got.\' Helen added: \'Internet scamming and horror stories of financial exploitation in general have made us all more wary and knowing I can trust my bank and other banks feels safe and stress-free. \'The admin side of shares feels too heavy and within the economic climate, it feels risky to invest in some organisations.\' In terms of what would motivate Helen to invest in shares, she said: \'More information available that is in layman’s terms that is clear to find. Transparency from providers, and perhaps having some time myself to research!\' <!- - ad: https://mads.dailymail.co.uk/v8/ca/money/diyinvesting/article/other/mpu_factbox.html?id=mpu_factbox_1 - -> The think-tank claimed wealth divisions in the UK were \'exacerbated\' by many Britons, particularly those on lower incomes, relying on cash Isas and cash savings accounts. However, some would argue that those on low incomes simply cannot afford to risk losing money tied up in fluctuating company shares or funds. A report for the Centre for Policy Studies, endorsed by City minister Andrew Griffith MP, has called for a new \'Retail Investment Strategy\' and a range of measures, akin to the ‘Tell Sid’ campaign of the 1980s, to move savings from cash into shares. The think-tank wants savers to be made more aware of the \'wealth-creating opportunities\' of investing in shares and create an environment whereby retail investors are on an equal footing with heavy-weight institutional ones. > Check the best savings rates in This is Money\'s independent tables Under the proposals, a proportion of new equity offered through IPOs would always be available to retail investors in future. It also wants to see the wording of disclaimers so they are more positive and \'realistic\' when it comes to the potential risks of investing in shares. The think-tank also suggests that cash ISAs and stocks and shares ISAs should be transferred into a single product. It said: \'Savers could maintain savings in cash but would be made more aware of the potential long-run returns of stocks and shares.\' The think-tank believes such changes \'could help the UK unlock capital and boost its appeal to businesses\'. It also cited Rishi Sunak\'s ‘A New Era for Retail Bonds’ 2017 report for the CPS, which said the failure of Britons to invest in the stock market represented \'a vast store of underworked capital’. People are getting poorer without realising Siam Kidd believes many don\'t even realise their cash savings are being eroded by inflation Siam Kidd, 37, lives in Norwich, and is a former RAF pilot turned full-time cryptocurrency trader. He also buys and sells businesses. He is in favour of investing over cash savings. He told This is Money: \'There is a large amount of cash sat on the side-lines wilting away like an ice cube in hot desert of inflation. People are getting poorer without realising. Purchasing power erosion is the insidious tax the public never seem to grasp.\' He added: \'Unfortunately, the UK is probably the most mainstream-narrative engrained nation out there. The majority of the public still believe that buying a house and working for 40-plus years whilst passively investing in mutual funds is a wise money plan, when in fact, it\'s mathematically impossible to get rich in a time efficient manner this way.\' He reckons Martin Lewis\' messaging over saving is \'seriously bad\'. Siam said: \'Saving costs here and there and constantly scurrying around looking for discounts will never get you out of your hole.\' However, Siam notes that it remains important to not put more money into investments that you can afford. He said: \'It\'s fundamentally critical that the amount of money you deploy into the markets is correlated to the amount of investing knowledge you have.\' Siam trades heavily in crypto, which won\'t suit everyone and can be very risky. However, on stock picking, Siam told This is Money: \'I\'d pick something that is in growing sectors with a good business model and good leadership.\' <!- - ad: https://mads.dailymail.co.uk/v8/ca/money/diyinvesting/article/other/mpu_factbox.html?id=mpu_factbox_2 - -> Potential short-term equity losses and gains are much greater than cash or UK Government bonds The report for the think-tank said there are 9.7million people in the UK with investable assets of more than £10,000 held in cash, and over four million of them want to take at least some form of investment risk. Yet at the moment, according to the think-tank, buying shares is treated by UK regulators as a \'more dangerous pursuit than gambling\'. It said high-street banks are \'discouraged\' from even suggesting that customers might benefit from moving their savings into shares, or offering easy ways to do this. King said: \'Successive governments have done far too little to address this, even ignoring opportunities like the selling off of the national stake in NatWest, which could have created a whole new generation of UK shareholders, but which were instead sold off to institutional investors.\' Myron Jobson, a senior personal finance analyst at Interactive Investor, said: \'Rampant inflation has turned the economic landscape on its head with interest rates racing ahead in a bid to quell rising prices. Savings rates have, in turn, regained some lustre after a decade in the doldrums, so there are now more options open to savers and investors. \'But the subsequent reprieve in cash savings rates has been drowned out by the stubborn persistence of high inflation - with the real value of savings remaining in the doldrums.\' Compare the best DIY investing platforms and stocks & shares Isas Investing online is simple, cheap and can be done from your computer, tablet or phone at a time and place that suits you.

Musk made his comments at the World AI Conference (WAIC), an event hosted by Chinese authorities to highlight Beijing’s AI ambitions. During an eight-minute video segment, Musk said: “China is going to be great at anything it puts its mind into. That includes many different sectors — sectors of the economy, but also artificial intelligence.” Musk did not directly address the potential impact of U.S. export restrictions in his speech. Currently, there are ongoing concerns over U.S. semiconductor export restrictions, which have hindered China’s AI development efforts and also created shortfalls in other areas such as cloud computing services. The SCMP also noted that the Biden administration is seemingly working on a plan to limit U.S. investments in Chinese AI, as first reported in May. The paper said that Musk has maintained strong relations with China in spite of these geopolitical tensions. During a visit in May, Musk met with several high-ranking Chinese officials, including foreign minister Qin Gang. There, he expressed opposition to a “decoupling” of the Chinese and American economies, in line with Beijing’s own position. Musk discusses Tesla’s AI work Musk also discussed Tesla’s AI efforts during his video segment. He noted that the company’s Optimus robot is designed to complement human labor. He also stated Tesla aims to create full-self driving technology at level 4 or 5 this year — terms that refer to “mind off” and “steering wheel optional” approaches to self-driving vehicles. He additionally suggested that robots and AI agents could exist alongside humans at a “one-to-one ratio” over time. He called for caution and regulatory oversight, echoing a letter that he signed with hundreds of other tech leaders in April 2023 . Apart from its focus on vehicles and AI, Tesla is a significant crypto investor. The firm’s Bitcoin holdings currently amount to 10,725 BTC ($324.2 million), according to some estimates . It also accepts Dogecoin (DOGE) for some merchandise.

South Korea meanwhile said Tokyo\'s plan to dilute the treated water and release it into the sea over several decades met or exceeded international standards. Some 1.33 million cubic metres of groundwater, rainwater and water used for cooling have accumulated at the Fukushima nuclear plant, where several reactors went into meltdown after the 2011 tsunami overwhelmed cooling systems. Storage space is running out, but plans by Japan and plant operator TEPCO to release the water into the sea have run into local and regional opposition. The UN nuclear watchdog this week said the discharge would have \"negligible\" effects on the environment and was in line with water releases from nuclear plants elsewhere. Japan\'s government has said the water release would begin by the end of summer, and on Friday the country\'s Nuclear Regulation Authority said the equipment and facilities to discharge the water had passed their checks. The Japanese government has spent months trying to win over public opinion at home and abroad, with everything from study tours of the plant to livestreamed experiments keeping marine life in the treated water. But neither those efforts nor the International Atomic Energy Agency\'s endorsement, have won over Beijing, which has accused Japan of treating the Pacific like a \"sewer\". China\'s customs authority on Friday said it would ban food imports from 10 Japanese prefectures over the release, and require stringent radiation tests on food from the rest of the country. \"China Customs will maintain a high level of vigilance,\" the authority said in a WeChat statement, without specifying the list of Japanese prefectures affected by the ban. Japan\'s foreign ministry told AFP it was \"studying\" possible measures in response. \"We will continue calling for the Chinese side to discuss (the issue) based on scientific viewpoints,\" a ministry official said, declining to be identified. South Korea, however, said Friday that its review of the plan found it in line with international standards. The study, which focused on whether the discharge would affect South Korean waters, found it would have \"negligible consequences\", policy coordination minister Bang Moon-kyu said. It would take up to 10 years for the treated water to circulate back into the seas around the Korean peninsula, Bang said. By then, the radiation level \"is projected... to be scientifically irrelevant\", he added. The discharged water is treated to remove almost all radioactive elements apart from tritium, which is commonly found in nuclear plant wastewater pumped into the sea. The water will be diluted with seawater before release, and then further diluted as it circulates in the ocean. Still, public concern about the plan in South Korea remains high. There have been protests and even panic-buying of salt based on fears that the Fukushima water will pollute the ocean and its salt. Some opposition lawmakers have even gone on hunger strike in protest. \"Japan wants to release the wastewater into the sea because it\'s the easiest and cheapest way to do so,\" Woo Won-shik, an MP who has been on hunger strike since June 26, told AFP. But at Seoul\'s sprawling Noryangjin Fish Market, many vendors said the opposition was bad for business. The media coverage \"is not helping us at all because it keeps people from coming\", one 80-year-old vendor, who only wished to be identified by her surname Moon, told AFP. IAEA head Rafael Grossi, who has been in Tokyo and Fukushima this week, travels to Seoul later Friday. \"My responsibility as head of the IAEA is to show up, to have a direct conversation with all those involved and to try to answer in the best, most honest possible way, the questions that may arise,\" he said. The IAEA, whose head Rafael Grossi visited Japan this week, has endorsed the plan to release treated water from the Fukushima nuclear plant AFP REGISTER FOR FREE to continue reading ✔️ Unlock the full content of International Business Times UK for free offer available for a limited time only ✔️ Easily manage your Newsletters subscriptions and save your favourite articles ✔️ No payment method required Already have an account?

The world\'s largest memory chip and smartphone maker estimated its April-June profit at 600 billion won ($461.2 million), significantly down from the 14.1 trillion won it reported a year ago. Samsung Galaxy Watch Update Will Offer Improved Wearing Detection for Users with Tattooed Wrists It marked the worst quarterly profit in 14 years since the first quarter of 2009, when the South Korean tech giant reported 590 billion won in operating profit, reports Yonhap news agency. Sales likely fell 22.3 per cent to 60 trillion won from the previous year\'s 77.2 trillion won, the company said in a regulatory filing. The data for net profit was not available. The tech giant did not provide the results of each business division and will release its final earnings report late this month. Samsung\'s Device Solutions division, which oversees its cash cow chip business, is forecast to have made losses of around 3-4 trillion won, according to analysts\' estimates. If the estimate holds, it would mark the division\'s second consecutive quarter of losses. During the January-March period, Samsung reported its first financial loss in 14 years as chip inventories bulged significantly amid tapering global demand Prior to that, Samsung\'s chip business recorded losses in the first quarter of 2009. Samsung Galaxy S8’s Crypto Key Stolen by Security Researchers via iPhone 13 Pro Max The chipmaker has forecast the global chip market will shrink 6 percent on-year to $563 billion this year, due to a sharp drop in demand, and warned of difficult conditions continuing throughout the year. But there are some positive forecasts that the chip cycle has bottomed out, with the prospect of a surge in demand for memory chips used in artificial intelligence (AI)-powered products and services, including the generative AI chatbot ChatGPT. Samsung Electronics shares have surged 29 per cent this year to date on that rosy prospect. That global memory chip makers have slashed production for the past few months added to that optimistic view. Samsung joined its peers earlier this year to cut production to resolve a persistent supply glut. \"Memory chip inventory levels are expected to peak out in the third quarter,\" Han Dong-hee, an analyst at SK securities, said. \"Samsung\'s performance will improve faster than the wider industry\'s recovery pace, as the impact of inventory write-downs will lessen.\" Industry tracker Trendforce warned, however, inventory levels \"persistently remain high\" despite chipmakers\' efforts to reduce supply, which keeps DRAM prices low. \"While production cutbacks may help to curtail quarterly price declines, a tangible recovery in prices may not be seen until 2024,\" it said.

Top ZachXBT Twitter Exposes Which Scammers Has ZachXBT Exposed? ZachXBT vs. BitBoy ZachXBT vs. Machi Big Brother A Well-Loved Crypto Sleuth ZachXBT – a name that can’t pass without recognition in today’s NFT industry. In the decentralized web3 world, this blockchain detective hunts down digital villains. He has exposed tens of NFT projects and influencers, including BitBoy and Tai Lopez, and he’s on our list of 20+ NFT Twitter accounts you don’t want to miss . At the time of writing, ZachXBT’s Twitter boasts over 422,000 followers. His impressive list of supporters features huge names in the Web3 industry, such as Beeple, Tron’s CEO Justin Sun, and Binance’s CEO Cangpeng Zhao. However, the everyday crypto and NFT traders are the most grateful for ZachXBT’s efforts to keep them safe. But who is this Batman of the Web3 era? Let’s find out: ZachXBT is the self-proclaimed crypto sleuth of the Web3 space. Who Is ZachXBT? ZachXBT is an anonymous Twitter user and crypto trader renowned for exposing NFT projects, and influencers’ rug pulls. This investigator first joined Twitter in 2015. However, their pro buono web3 detective career started in May 2021 when they spotted the first NFT scams. Since then, ZachXBT has used his impressive chain analysis experience to dive deep into every project or person, raising eyebrows. Do We Know ZachXBT’s Real Identity? Nobody knows who ZachXBT is right now, but there are a few clues. In June 2023, the anonymous detective posted on Twitter a part of the lawsuit paperwork that Jeffery ‘Machi’ Huang filed against him (more on that below). In that photo, we can see that his last name is Zachary and that the US District Court for the Western District of Texas, Austin, issued the document. This is, in fact, the most information ZachXBT has ever revealed about their true identity. While we don’t know who’s the person behind the screen, their actions might speak more than an ID card. The following Twitter exposes are the perfect examples! ZachXBT had been keeping an eye on Pixelmon’s NFT release before Kevin went viral. Top ZachXBT Twitter Exposes In essence, ZachXBT uses Twitter to expose NFT scams. They include details about the scammers and evidence for each accusation. Here are a few top examples: PixelMon Remember last year’s viral Kevin NFT memes ? Those came from PixelMon’s 2022 NFT project, advertised as anything but what it was. Initially, the project was introduced as a high-utility NFT collection allegedly tied to a game that would launch later on. PixelMon even bragged about their NFTs being ‘fully modeled 3D characters that you can interact with.’ This information generated so much hype that PixelMon’s mint raised over $70m with 3 ETH per mint! Then the grand reveal happened, and it looked like this: Credits: Twitter Although collectors had mixed reactions, Kevin became one of the most popular memes in NFT history. PixelMon apologized for the huge fail and promised to use the funds to continue the project. Of course, ZachXBT tracked the funds, at the time, in a multisig wallet. After the mint, hundreds of ETH were transferred to various addresses. The team’s dev address used 400 ETH to buy blue chip NFTs, such as Bored Ape Yacht Club or Azuki, allegedly as an investment for the project. Moreover, PixelMon claimed to use their own team to develop the NFT game. In February 2022, ZachXBT posted multiple pieces of evidence of how project devs were, in fact, buying digital artwork from the Unity platform. Rogue Society is another popular NFT project exposed by ZachXBT. Rogue Society This robot-themed cool PFP NFT collection dropped in September 2021 with a promising roadmap. Their mint successfully raised $5.5 million, which turned out to be a slow rug. Ultimately, the anonymous founder vanished with the money and the incomplete roadmap. Once again, ZachXBT stepped up to expose the founder : Jahvin Bowman, aka @LecheTheMilky, on Twitter. According to the detective, even the freelance artist who created the Rogue Society NFT artwork was scammed . After this information was revealed, Rogue Society launched an alleged $5k song competition on their Discord. However, ZachXBT spotted one of the founding team members also joined the contest and won the staged contest. ZachXBT exposed SolChicks for using fake bots, fake reviews, and other malicious strategies. SolChicks This web3 PvP game launched back in 2022 on the Solana blockchain with an NFT collection of breedable ‘SolChicks.’ The project was advertised as one of the top experiences on Solana – but that image quickly vanished after the team’s documents were leaked on social media. As usual, ZachXBT reposted the documents from one of the SolChicks team members’ public accounts. Shockingly, there was evidence of buying fake Twitter followers, Discord bots, and fake Reddit reviews. These are just some of the projects ZachXBT has exposed in recent years. The list also includes projects like SolanaValley, MissUniverseNFT, Rich Bulls Club, and MoonRabbit. Which Scammers Has ZachXBT Exposed? Besides NFT projects, ZachXBT has also exposed many Venture Capitals (VCs) and NFT influencers. For example, the top companies are MoonRock Capital, DarkPool Ventures, and BlueZilla. If those names ring a bell, let’s check out the most popular influencers ZachXBT investigated: ZachXBT exposed Laurent Correia for scamming users with his project, Billionaire Dogs Club. Laurent Correia Let’s travel back in time to December 2021, when Billionaire Dogs Club launched. This collection of 6,500 NFTs dropped with a 0.2 ETH price per piece. The project’s marketing involved a luxury lifestyle, wealth, cars, and massive giveaways. When the minting didn’t go as planned, the founders reduced their NFT supply to 2,000 assets. By the following week, the project’s Discord and website disappeared. In April 2022, ZachXBT doxxed the project founder: the French reality TV star Laurent Correia . As it turned out, the influencer used the funds to buy CloneX, Doodles , and MAYC NFTs that he bragged about on Twitter. Tai Lopez, a popular crypto investor and ‘grifter,’ was scamming users, according to ZachXBT. Tai Lopez In March 2022, the crypto community turned its eyes to Tai Lopez, an entrepreneur, influencer, and self-proclaimed ‘aspiring renaissance man.’ The investor had launched the NFT collection “OG (Original Garage) Social Club. ” Available in three tiers, these collectibles would offer access to courses like ‘Bitcoin Crypto Mastermind,’ giveaways, and other experiences from and with Tai Lopez. The price range was between 0.1 – 10 ETH. The problem, according to ZachXBT, is Tai Lopez’s history of scams . For example, he hosted several fake giveaways years ago. In fact, many of his pricey courses allegedly offered basic information about crypto and NFTs. After ZachXBT’s accusations, Tai Lopez deleted several inculpatory posts. Logan Paul is among the most popular public figures exposed by ZachXBT. Logan Paul Last year, in May 2022, ZachXBT exposed Logan Paul for promoting so-called “pump and dump” NFT projects (aka scams). As evidence shows, the influencer used to hype up shady tokens or projects several days before they disappeared with the money. ZachXBT’s research revealed how Logan Paul used various addresses to redirect funds to or from his public address. Some of the scam projects he supported are DinkDoink, Elongate, or $F**KELON. ZachXBT exposed BitBoy Crypto for promoting project scams for several years. ZachXBT vs. BitBoy Ben Armstrong, aka BitBoy Crypto, is among the biggest influencers exposed by ZachXBT . According to the detective, this crypto advisor made a fortune by promoting many NFT project scams. Depending on the promotion method, he would receive between $2,500 – $40,000 per ad. Before being exposed by ZachXBT, BitBoy was very open about ‘rigorously vetting all paid promotions.’ However, data collected by ZachXBT proved otherwise. In January 2022, they tweeted evidence of seven NFT projects or token scams that ran away with the profits – all promoted by BitBoy. In fact, the community even warned the influencer about some of those projects being fake, including $MYX Network. After the projects rugged, BitBoy also deleted his ads – but the NFT community can’t forget, and ZachXBT shined the spotlight on each piece of evidence. These are just a few of the top influencers ZachXBT exposed in recent years. The long list of scammers also includes Artchick, Jay Alvarrez, 888, 6ix9ine, to name a few. Some blocked him, some confronted him via Twitter, but one of the exposed figures took the problem to court. Here’s what you should know: On June 16th, Machi Big Brother filed a lawsuit against ZachXBT for his accusations. ZachXBT vs. Machi Big Brother Jeff Huang, known as Machi Big Brother, is a Taiwan-based entrepreneur and Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT whale. An ex-member of the L.A. Boyz band, he founded the Asian hip-hop label MACHI Entertainment in the 2000s, which became very successful. In fact, ZachXBT’s evidence on Machi Big Brother’s malicious NFT practices is just as impressive as his resume. Telegram posts, Medium articles, and a myriad of sketchy transactions all point out to what ZachXBT calls ‘sketchy projects with shadowy team members, questionable ethics, and rote pump and dump practices.’ Out of all the accusations, the blockchain treasury management platform Formosa Financial is the most notable. In short, ZachXBT found two withdrawals of 11,000 ETH each from the project’s treasury wallet. Cofounder George Hsieh made these withdrawals without other investors knowing. By following transactions, the detective found that Machi Big Brother was involved in this shady transfer. Machi replied to these accusations, saying that it’s misinformation and that ‘if he weren’t anon, I’d sue him for defamation.’ Unfortunately, that’s exactly what he did on June 16th, 2023. Since he was sued by Machi Big Brother , ZachXBT started accepting donations from the community to handle the legal costs of the lawsuit (which will exceed $1 million). This unfortunate event showed how much the crypto and NFT communities support ZachXBT. For example, de donors list includes Coinbase, Uniswap, Binance, Bybit, and OKX, to name a few. In 2022, Beeple launched an artwork to honor ZachXBT’s journey in the NFT space. A Well-Loved Crypto Sleuth From an anonymous collector who got scammed years ago to keeping the NFT community safe, ZachXBT is a key part of today’s Web3 space. Their meticulosity helped them expose top influencers and NFT projects throughout the years and prevent other victims. This enormous effort is appreciated by NFT newbies, crypto investors, and iconic figures in the space too. Even one of the best-selling NFT artists worldwide, Beeple , has dedicated an NFT artwork to ZachXBT featuring their Twitter profile avatar. Although nobody can predict the outcome of ZachXBT’s lawsuit, one thing is certain: he is a beloved crypto sleuth.

Fans immediately began speculating that she was taking Ozempic — a diabetes drug — to assist with her weight loss. In a June 2023 interview with Bustle, which was published on July 6, Jessica shut down those rumors. “Oh Lord,” she said. “I mean, it’s not [Ozempic].” She then expanded on how she’s been able to keep off the weight since giving birth to her third child, Birdie, in 2019. “It’s willpower,” she insisted. “I’m like, do people want me to be drinking again? Because that’s when I was heavier. Or do they want me to have another baby? My body can’t do it.” Jessica quit drinking in 2017 and was open about her struggles with alcoholism in her 2020 memoir, Open Book. After having Birdie, Jessica lost 100 pounds and has worked hard to keep the weight off and tone her figure in the years since. While she said that she’s still “hurt” when it comes to negative comments about her body, she’s able to rise above it. “Am I going to let the negativity derail me? No, I’m too old for that,” she shared. “I’m too connected to myself right now to let that derail me. It doesn’t mean that it doesn’t hurt.” Plus, Jess said that having “been every size” helped her when it comes to her brand and “understanding” the women who buy her products. Despite not having released music or acted in anything in years, Jessica has managed to maintain a spot in the limelight, and even she admits that it “boggles [her] mind” that people are still so curious about her. Her old reality show with ex-husband, Nick Lachey, Newlyweds, has even gotten a new following from TikTok in recent months. Fans who have discovered the show today have started labeling Nick as the “villain” on the show for how he treated Jessica. When asked about how the public viewed him as a “stand-up” husband back in the day, Jessica simply responded, “It’s amazing what publicity can do.” Now, Jess is married to Eric Johnson. In addition to four-year-old Birdie, they also share a daughter, Maxwell, 11, and a son, Ace, 10. Tamaryn Green was announced as the guest judge of Crown Chasers‘ first episode. The Miss South Africa reality show will begin this Sunday and it has Bonang Matheba as a judge, while Zozibini Tunzi will host the show.

With United focusing on deals for Andre Onana and Rasmus Hojlund, Ten Hag is keen on raising transfer funds through player sales. Ten Hag is looking to sell as many as 13 first team players this summer , although some of them might be harder to shift than others. According to talkSPORT , Dean Henderson, Fred and Anthony Elanga are ‘likely to leave in the coming weeks’ which will be a boost. Henderson isn’t expected to join United on their pre-season tour as he pushes for a £30m move to Nottingham Forest. The goalkeeper doesn’t want to warm the bench at Old Trafford and an exit seems more than likely at this point. Following the arrival of Mason Mount, the club are also expected to push ahead with plans to sell Fred this summer. The Brazilian midfielder has attracted interest from Fulham, although they aren’t willing to meet United’s current asking price. It’s currently being suggested that United are looking for around £20m for the midfielder, but Fulham deems this price to be too high. Elanga also looks likely to depart, with Galatasaray interested in taking the 21-year-old on loan for the season. Last season proved to be a frustrating campaign for Elanga as the winger struggled to nail down a starting spot. Across all competitions, he featured in 26 matches, although the majority of his appearances came from the bench. Elanga himself even admitted it had been a frustrating campaign for him back in March. “It is frustrating. You want to play,” Elanga told reporters. “It is important. But if you don’t play, it’s not up to me but up to the coach. “I have spoken to Erik [ten Hag] and it is private between the two of us. I know what he wants me to do and I can just keep training hard. When the opportunity comes, I just have to be ready to take it.” While United seem confident in selling that trio, some other players could prove harder to shift. According to reports, United are finding it hard to sell Harry Maguire due to a recent pay rise which was triggered in his contract.

After Musa Khawula claimed Mihlali Ndamase had beaten him up, the gorgeous beauty influencer came in guns blazing and admitted to it via a post on her Instagram Stories. “I’d do it again. Tell them how you were crying when I beat you up. Never think you can get away with disrespecting my mom,” Ndamase wrote. Khawula said Ndamase allegedly attacked him on Thursday, 29 June at her boyfriend’s office. “Warning: The content contained within this article features imagery which readers may find disturbing.” “Mihlali Ndamase’s wish is to f**ken get my eye…This is crazy. It’s been a rough few days,” the blogger said. Khawula explained that he was with his friends and they decided to go grab some food and drinks at an unspecified hotel. He said he had heard of a story and wanted to verify it by Ndamase’s boyfriend, Leeroy Sandabe. The Pope of Pop Culture host said he spoke to Ndamase’s boyfriend on the phone and was invited to drop by Sandabe’s office to talk face-to-face. “That’s how we end[ed] up at the office. MJ lite (Mihlali Ndamase) is there at the office. [And] we go and greet her,” Khawula said. The controversial entertainment blogger said he realized that Ndamase was upset with him when he went over to greet her. He then recalled that he had previously called her mother a wh*re which is why she was angry at him. He said she went to make herself a cup of coffee and caught a glimpse of her having a quick word with Sandabe. The next thing, she allegedly attacked him with boiling water. “The second time she comes back, she’s carrying this hot a** boiling water and then she throws this water…It’s a whole thing. She’s throwing phones… She hit me with the iPhone at the corner of my eye,” the blogger said. When Khawula realised he had grown a huge bump on his face, he asked Ndamase if she could see what she had done. Instead of being sympathetic, Ndamase allegedly threatened to hit him some more. The office security guards were said to have come in at that point and broke up the fight. Thereafter, the blogger exited the building. “Warning: The content contained within this article features imagery which readers may find disturbing.” In 2022, actor, and TV presenter Moshe Ndiki was showered with praise by fellow celebrities and fans after he got into a physical altercation with Khawula, The Citizen reported.

Logistics companies have adapted their operations to meet the demands of the e-commerce boom, prioritising last-mile deliveries and leveraging technologies like AI and IoT for improved efficiency and customer experience. Amit Choudhary, the Chief Product and Technology Officer at Ecom Express, spoke with Express Computer about the company’s role in the logistics sector as well as numerous other topics. He emphasised the tremendous changes that have occurred in the logistics industry over the last few years, including the rapid expansion of e-commerce, the demand for quicker and more efficient delivery, and the growing attention paid to sustainability. With the ever-growing consumer demands, new startups cropping up, and the constant push to innovate, the logistics sector has been on its toes more than ever. What are the top changes you are seeing in this sector over the last couple of years? The logistics sector has undergone profound transformations in recent years, catalysed by various factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic, technological advancements, and shifting consumer behavior. One of the most notable changes has been the exponential growth of the e-commerce sector, which has had a profound impact on the logistics industry. The surge in online shopping has led to a significant increase in the volume of small and customised deliveries, prompting logistics companies to adapt their operations accordingly. With the rise of e-commerce, customers now expect faster and more efficient deliveries. In response, logistics companies have prioritised last-mile deliveries and order fulfilment to meet these growing consumer demands. To achieve this, they have leveraged technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), and automation. These advancements have improved the consumer experience by enabling real-time tracking and tracing of packages, enhancing visibility in the supply chain, and streamlining operational processes. Additionally, the logistics industry has witnessed a significant shift towards adopting green mobility solutions. With a greater emphasis on sustainability, logistics companies have embraced environmentally friendly practises to reduce carbon emissions. One notable development is the widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EVs). Moreover, this shift towards green mobility has attracted environmentally conscious customers who prefer businesses that prioritise sustainability. Environmental sustainability is a significant focus for Ecom Express. To reduce its carbon footprint and promote recycling, the company has replaced plastic bins with eco-friendly corrugated bins made from recycled cardboard. This proactive choice supports a greener future and aligns with their commitment to environmental responsibility.

With rising internet penetration, smartphone adoption, and evolving consumer preferences, e-commerce companies are expected to expand their operations and drive demand for efficient logistics and last-mile delivery services. Infrastructure development: The Indian government has been actively investing in infrastructure development, including roadways, railways, and ports. These initiatives aim to enhance logistics efficiency and facilitate faster and more reliable movement of goods, thus benefiting the logistics industry. Technology adoption: The logistics industry in India is gradually embracing technology solutions to improve operational efficiency and visibility. Implementation of warehouse management systems, transportation management systems, route optimisation software, and real-time tracking solutions is on the rise. The integration of emerging technologies such as the IoT, AI, and blockchain is expected to further streamline supply chain processes and enhance overall logistics operations. Warehousing and distribution centres: With the expansion of the e-commerce industry and the increasing complexity of supply chains, there is a growing demand for strategically located warehousing and distribution centers across India. The rise of third-party logistics (3PL) providers and the need for organised warehousing facilities will drive the growth of such infrastructure. These trends indicate a positive outlook for the logistics industry in India, with continued growth and opportunities for companies to adapt to changing market dynamics and leverage technology for improved efficiency.', NULL, NULL, 'https://www.expresscomputer.in/exclusives/logistics-sector-in-india-set-for-positive-outlook-fueled-by-e-commerce-and-technology-adoption-amit-choudhary-chief-product-and-technology-officer-ecom-express/100752/', '2023-07-07 05:05:25', 'india', NULL, '2023-07-07 11:30:01', '2023-07-07 11:30:01', 2, 'Exclusives;News;Ecom Express', NULL, 0),

With 350-odd cashew units being shut, the livelihoods of over 20,000 workers are at stake.

Cashew nuts imported from Vietnam at a cheaper price are also hurting the manufacturers in Palasa. This has forced the Palasa Cashew Manufacturers’ Association to call for a strike as they are unable to bear the expense of operating the units. “The rise in imports has resulted in a sudden decline in the price of the commodity to Rs 625 from Rs 800 per kg of the 180-grade variety. As the input cost for processing cashew nuts has increased due to the surge in power tariff and labour charges, we are incurring hefty losses,” Palasa Industrial Estate Cashew Association President M Rameswara Rao lamented.

Demanding the State government to set up a cashew development board similar to the one in Kerala, Rameswara Rao said the board can then resolve issues related to cashew production and marketing.

Royal Charity Polo Cup 2023 today. The royals, who have been known to embrace in PDAs, saw the opportunity to let loose as Kate enjoyed a glass of champagne while cheering on her husband. And while the royal family often keep a stiff upper lip, the polo appears to be a time when they can let their hair down. William and Kate also embraced last year at the Guards Polo Club. Meanwhile, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle also enjoy a PDA. The pair shared a kiss in front of a crowd at the polo last May, in an intimate moment that was a far cry from Charles and Diana\'s tense public interactions. Princess Kate embraced Prince William in a sweet hug kiss at Out-Sourcing Inc. Royal Charity Polo Cup 2023 today William and Kate also embraced last year at the Guards Polo Club The Duchess of Sussex , 41, planted a kiss on her husband as she presented his team with a trophy at the Santa Barbara Polo & Racquet Club, near their mansion in Montecito, California . Meghan, who was dressed in a wide brim hat, polka dot blouse and high-waisted trousers, placed her hands either side of her husband\'s face, while he pulled her close with a hand on her back. The tender clinch, captured on camera for all the world to see, is part of a tradition of polo-playing princes being \'rewarded\' for their efforts with a post-match kiss. Prince Charles and Diana were captured locking lips on a number of occasions, although their PDA was far chillier than the Sussexes\' romantic moments. A kiss for the crowd! The Duke and Duchess shared a kiss on stage after Los Padres won the memorial cup Tense: The affectionate display was a world away from the tense and distant peck Charles and Diana shared following his polo victory in 1985, just four years after their wedding Distant: Polo-playing princes typically receive a kiss from their beloved as a \'reward\' and it\'s a chance for the public to see some PDA.

The breakdown of their marriage was revealed to the world when Diana swerved her head at the moment of kiss in India in 1992, leaving her husband\'s painfully pursed lips making contact with the side of her hair. The couple also looked tense on a number of other occasions, with Diana looking glum as Charles showed off his sporting prowess on the pitch. It is a world apart from Harry and Meghan who couldn\'t keep their hands off each other. After giving each of Harry\'s teammates a peck on the cheek, she planted a kiss on Harry\'s lips while he put a hand on her back to pull her close. As a gust of wind threatened to pull her hat from her head, Meghan placed a hand gently on Harry\'s arm, before spotting her lipstick smudge and wiping his face.

Judi James said the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge\'s kiss was the \'opposite\' to the Prince and Princess of Wales in the image. She revealed: \' While William and Kate’s lingering kiss suggested suppressed affection Charles and Diana looked as though they had no relationship or even connection between them in private. \'The kiss was clumsy and awkward with no suggestion of a normally-tactile relationship or even chemistry together. There is no synchronicity here. \'Diana leans forward but also away from her husband and their clutches look misplaced and lacking in any affection. \'Diana has deflected the kiss by turning her head away. This rejection means Charles is left to plant his kiss on her hair instead of her cheek. \'His splayed fingers on her back showed a lack of desire for any form of touch and his ugly grimace as he miss-kisses looks miserable.\' Share or comment on this article: How the royal family often have PDAs at polo matches e-mail Add comment Comments 2 Share what you think Newest Oldest Best rated Worst rated View all The comments below have been moderated in advance.

The camp is bustling with thousands of pilgrims embarking on their journey to the cave shrine in the south Kashmir Himalayas. To ensure that no devotee goes hungry, numerous langars are serving as the lifeline for the pilgrims. With 30 langars (community kitchens) spread across Jammu, the needs of over 4,000 to 5,000 pilgrims arriving daily from various parts of the country are being met. The langars embody the spirit of generosity, offering free vegetarian meals that showcase culinary diversity from different regions. “Various social and religious organisations have set up a number of langars in Jammu city, the highest number of them located at Bhagwati Nagar base camp. This is the service of God. We express our gratitude to them all,” Corporator Sanjay Baru told PTI. Pilgrims from different parts of the country, including locals, have come forward to establish langars for the yatra. “From morning till late at night, we provide simple yet satisfying dishes like dal, chawal and ambal, and other popular delicacies from Jammu to all pilgrims,” said Raj Kumar Gupta, the head of one ‘Bajrang langar’ set up at the base camp. MP Jugal Kishore Sharma said, “Thousands of people contribute to this greatest act of humanity, providing free langars to pilgrims during the two-month-long yatra.” Hundreds of volunteers also work tirelessly round the clock for the community kitchens to ensure that every pilgrim’s needs are satisfied. Rahul Kumar, a volunteer who hails from Madhya Pradesh, expressed his enthusiasm for the work at the langar. “Our dedicated team has eagerly awaited the start of the Amarnath Yatra. Now, we are serving pilgrims day and night, pouring our hearts into this selfless service,” he said. Pilgrims have also expressed their satisfaction with the food management at the langars, appreciating the wide variety of options available at the base camp. Narinder Kumar from Pune said, “The langars here have exceeded our expectations. The diverse range of dishes from various langars truly represents the unity of our nation and we are grateful for it.” Apart from providing nourishing meals, the base camp also offers daily musical shows and cultural performances, providing entertainment and respite for the pilgrims. “The musical shows and mandalis held here are a wonderful way to unwind after the arduous journey. They bring joy and create a sense of community among the pilgrims,” Sushma Rathore from Jaipur said. The Baba Amarnath Bavalpuri Seva Mandal from Punjab has been setting up langars in Jammu and Kashmir for the past 23 years. They provide morning tea, lunch, evening tea, and dinner to pilgrims at the Chandanwari base camp. Vinod Kumar, the head of the community kitchen, said he was honoured to serve the devotees of Lord Shiva and that providing meals and beverages is the langar’s contribution to the sacred pilgrimage. The langars also strictly adhere to the government’s ban on over 40 food items during the yatra, which was issued following directives of the shrine board. “We diligently follow the orders of the shrine board, ensuring that no banned items are sold or prepared here,” said Rahul Kumar, the langar’s food in charge. The 62-day annual pilgrimage to the 3,888-metre-high cave shrine in the south Kashmir Himalayas commenced from the twin tracks of Pahalgam in Anantnag district and Baltal in Ganderbal district on July 1. Over 65,000 pilgrims have paid obeisance at Amarnath, while over 36,000 pilgrims have left the Jammu base camp for the Kashmir Valley in seven batches. The seventh batch of over 6,500 Amarnath Yatra pilgrims left Jammu in the early hours of Thursday for the twin base camps in Kashmir amid tight security, officials said. The 62-day annual pilgrimage to the 3,888-metre-high cave shrine in the south Kashmir Himalayas commenced from the twin tracks of Pahalgam in Anantnag district and Baltal in Ganderbal district on July 1. The officials said the pilgrim footfall at the shrine has crossed the 65,000 mark and the yatra is progressing smoothly, with devotees from across the country thronging the base camps to have a glimpse of the naturally formed ice shivling and offer their prayers. A total of 6,554 pilgrims — 5,053 male, 1,375 women, 101 seers and 25 children — left Bhagwati Nagar base camp here for the Valley in a convoy of 272 vehicles amid tight security arrangements in the early hours of Thursday, they said. The officials said 3,864 pilgrims, headed for Pahalgam, left in a convoy of 141 vehicles for the Valley, while another convoy of 131 vehicles carrying 2,690 pilgrims left for the Baltal base camp at 3.30 am. With this, a total of 36,823 pilgrims have left the Jammu base camp for the valley since June 30 when the first batch of pilgrims began the yatra, which was flagged off by Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha. The yatra is scheduled to conclude on August 31. The administration has registered over 3,000 fresh pilgrims on tatkal yatra counters in Jammu for their onward journey to Amarnath, officials said. Over 300 pilgrims, who were carrying fake permits, have also been given permits after fresh registration at on-the-spot counters in Jammu. These pilgrims were duped by the travel agencies by providing them fake registration documents for their yatra. Three persons have been arrested in this connection so far, they said.', NULL, NULL, 'https://kashmirobserver.net/2023/07/06/langars-become-lifeline-for-amarnath-pilgrims/', '2023-07-06 08:41:08', 'india', NULL, '2023-07-07 12:34:51', '2023-07-07 12:34:51', 2, 'LOCAL', 'jaipur', 0),
(2004, 'News24.com-or-Facebook-alters-fact-checking-controls-for-US-users', 'News24.com | Facebook alters fact-checking controls for US users', 'Meta-owned Facebook has handed US users the controls over fact-checked content', 'Meta-owned Facebook has handed US users the controls over fact-checked content, in a potentially significant move that the platform says will give them more power over its algorithm but some analysts insist could benefit purveyors of misinformation. For years, Facebook\'s algorithm automatically moved posts lower in the feed if they were flagged by one of the platform\'s third-party fact-checking partners, including AFP, reducing the visibility of false or misleading content. Under a new \"content reduced by fact-checking\" option that now appears in Facebook\'s settings, users have flexibility to make debunked posts appear higher or lower in the feed or maintain the status quo. Fact-checked posts can be made less visible with an option called \"reduce more.\" That, according to the platform\'s settings, means the posts \"may be moved even lower in feed so you may not see them at all.\" Another option labeled \"don\'t reduce\" triggers the opposite effect, moving more of this content higher in their feed, making it more likely to be seen. \"We\'re giving people on Facebook even more power to control the algorithm that ranks posts in their feed,\" a Meta spokesman told AFP. \"We\'re doing this in response to users telling us that they want a greater ability to decide what they see on our apps.\" Meta rolled out the fact-checking option in May, leaving many users to discover it for themselves in the settings. It comes amid a hyperpolarised political climate in the United States that has made content moderation on social media platforms a hot-button issue. Conservative US advocates allege that the government has pressured or colluded with platforms such as Facebook and Twitter to censor or suppress right-leaning content under the guise of fact-checking. On Tuesday, a federal court in Louisiana restricted some top officials and agencies of President Joe Biden\'s administration from meeting and communicating with social media companies to moderate their content. Separately, misinformation researchers from prominent institutions such as the Stanford Internet Observatory face a Republican-led congressional inquiry as well as lawsuits from conservative activists who accuse them of promoting censorship - a charge they deny. \'Exposure to misinformation\' The changes on Facebook come ahead of the 2024 presidential vote, when many researchers fear political falsehoods could explode across social media platforms. The move has also prompted concern from some analysts that it could be a boon for misinformation peddlers. \"Downranking content that fact-checkers rate as problematic is a central part of Facebook\'s anti-misinformation program,\" David Rand, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, told AFP. \"Allowing people to simply opt out seems to really knee-cap the program.\" Meta downplayed the concerns, saying it will still attach labels to content that is found to be misleading or false, making it clear that it was rated by one of its third-party fact-checkers. The company said it was exploring whether to expand this control to other countries. Meta\'s spokesperson said: Aside from this control, Facebook is also allowing users to decide the degree to which they want to view \"low quality content,\" such as clickbait and spam, and \"sensitive content,\" including violent or graphic posts, on the platform. The impact of the changes, analysts say, is only likely to be known over time when more users - especially those who distrust professional fact-checkers - start tweaking their settings. Fact-checkers, who are not able to review every post on the mammoth platform, routinely face an avalanche of online abuse from people who dispute their ratings - sometimes even when they peddle blatantly false or misleading information. \"Someone who dislikes or distrusts the role of fact-checkers could use it to try to avoid seeing fact-checks,\" Emma Llanso, from the Center for Democracy & Technology, told AFP. Facebook, she said, should be researching and testing whether it will increase or decrease users\' \"exposure to misinformation\" before it rolls it out more widely around the world. \"Ideally they should share the results of that kind of research in an announcement about the new feature,\" Llanso added.', 'https://scripts.24.co.za/img/sites/news24.png', NULL, 'https://www.news24.com/news24/Tech-and-Trends/News/facebook-alters-fact-checking-controls-for-us-users-20230707', '2023-07-07 06:32:13', 'south africa', NULL, '2023-07-07 13:00:05', '2023-07-07 13:00:05', 3, NULL, '', 0),

This new grant aims to replenish funds to cover cost overruns related to repairs recently identified at the Cap-Haïtien International Airport, to boost the country’s aviation sector and ensure that the airport continues to meet international standards set out by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).

During a lengthy interview he had with Sports Illustrated , the former WWE star turned All Elite Wrestling (AEW) megastar had a \"dissertation\" about blood\'s place. \"This is a combat sport. The lowest prelim bout of a UFC card or a boxing card, somebody might have a little blood on their eyebrow or blood coming out of their nose. But they\'re not selling a blood sport... It\'s part of the aesthetic. It adds realism,\" Moxley stated. He would later reference his bloody and hard-hitting matchup with Japanese legend Tomohiro Ishii and even though he has been criticized for constantly bleeding in his matches, Moxley simply does not care for what others think. Most recently, Moxley practically broke internet wrestling circles when he and fellow American performer Homicide faced Japanese wrestling stars El Desperado and Jun Kasai in an ultraviolent no disqualification tag team match at NJPW Strong Independence Day 2023 Day 1 on July 4 at the famed Korakuen Hall in Tokyo, Japan. The spot that blew up social media at the time was Kasai laughing in the background as the top of Moxley\'s head had skewers sticking out of it and a snapshot of that moment can be viewed here . (Note: the above link contains content that may not be suitable for all readers.) While fans believe Moxley has developed a type of addiction to bleeding, he wants to bring a sense of realism to the bizarro world of pro wrestling where suspension of disbelief is king. \"People ask why there is blood in the ring every time I leave it. It feels unnatural to go out of my way to make sure no one is bleeding. That feels like I\'m taking my foot off the gas pedal. That doesn\'t interest me,\" Moxley declared. However, there is an interesting point that the man known as Dean Ambrose in WWE raised. \"I\'m actually for less blood but more often. If every single match on the card had a busted eyebrow or bloody nose, it would just be part of the sport. But some gory spectacle with blood shooting like a hose is pretty unnecessary,\" he said. \"We\'re elbowing each other in the face every single match. We\'re kicking each other in the face every single match. What are these people made of if they\'re not bleeding?\" Blood has played a big role in the growth of the pro wrestling industry. While fans have differing opinions about it, Moxley\'s defense of it is an interesting take on whether it deserves a place in the business now. Jon Moxley as AEW World Champion.

Manfred Genditzki had been handed a life sentence for allegedly killing an 87-year-old tenant of the building where he worked in 2008 by striking her on the head during a dispute and then drowning her. Genditzki had consistently denied murdering the woman during a lengthy legal battle. In a judicial scandal that made national headlines, the judges of the regional court in Munich ruled that Genditzki had been wrongly convicted and ordered compensation of nearly 369,000 euros ($402,000). \"It was not a murder, he is acquitted and thus innocent,\" a court spokesman said, referring to new evidence suggesting the death was accidental. Local media reported that Genditzki sat impassively as the verdict was read out while many of his supporters wept openly in the courtroom. Genditzki, now 63, who had worked in a large residential complex in the southern town of Rottach-Egern, had already successfully contested his conviction before a federal tribunal but was found guilty again by a Munich court in 2012. In a third trial based on advances in forensic science, his defence attorney Regina Rick was able to bring in new evidence showing that the water temperature in the tub where the woman was found pointed to a far different time of death than initially presumed. A second scientific report presented to the court used a computer simulation to demonstrate that her death was likely the result of an accident. Rick won her client\'s preliminary release last August on the basis of that evidence, given the mounting doubts about his guilt and Genditzki\'s previously clean criminal record. After more than 13 years in custody, he returned to his family and began working as a driver at a cheese factory while the regional court granted him a new trial. Friday\'s acquittal, which even the prosecution ultimately advocated, \"came on the basis of expert reports using the most modern methods which were not available at the time of the previous convictions\", the court spokesman said. After spending 4,915 days wrongly imprisoned in which he missed taking part in raising his children or witnessing the birth of his grandchildren, Genditzki is now exonerated, he said. \"This is a tragedy that can hardly be put into words,\" he added. The court ordered Genditzki to be paid 75 euros for every day he spent in jail, amounting to just over 368,000 euros. He may also be able to claim additional damages for lost income.

As she eyes her first China Ladies Professional Golf Association (CLPGA) title in six years, Prima will welcome the chance to stay in bed. After all, ample rest was pivotal to the Thai’s blistering second round at the Laguna National Golf Resort Club. The 31-year-old, who slept more than 20 hours across Wednesday and Thursday night to try and recover from an illness, said: “This morning I felt very rested. I hit more fairways today, gave myself a lot more opportunities and my putter was working really nicely so that was good.” The world No. 895 attributed her performance on Friday to her putting as she mixed eight birdies with three bogeys. She said: “I was feeling very confident on the green so I gave myself very good opportunities and was able to make the putt because my putter was working so that was key. “I made a few birdies but I also made a few bogeys like a few sloppy ones so it’s going to be a bit of adjustment to the tee shots and trying to hit even more fairways tomorrow.” She almost withdrew an hour before the US$100,000 (S$135,200) tournament began on Thursday as she felt unwell but now sits on six-under 138 with the clubhouse lead. Prima, who completed her morning round before inclement weather in the afternoon forced organisers to suspend play, is one shot clear ahead of Chinese Taipei’s Chang Tzu-yi (70) while her compatriot Pakin Kawinpakorn and overnight leader Sui Xiang from China are also at five-under before the heavy rain came. Malaysian Genevieve Ling (68) and Sherman Santiwiwatthanaphong (72) of Thailand are a further stroke back on 140. China’s Ji Yuai is also four-under with eight holes remaining. Fifth-eight players will return to the course early on Saturday morning to finish their second rounds, while Prima will certainly use the later tee time to recharge. She can also count on the support from familiar faces. Her parents Supoj and Piriyapom, who flew over from Thailand, have been following her throughout the tournament, filming and photographing their daughter. It is the first time in about five years that they have jumped onto a plane to watch her compete. While she joked that the real reason they were here was for some Singaporean cuisine, Prima added: “When I was sick the first night that was not pretty, so I’m glad they got to see some good shots to make up for that. “I usually play in the United States so it’s hard for them to travel that far, it’s nice to have them around. I really enjoy having them on the course with me.” On the hunt for her first professional title is Ling, who is tied-fifth and within striking distance of Prima. A bogey on the 17th hole blotted an otherwise flawless scorecard that featured five birdies. After her rookie season on the Ladies European Tour in 2022, she is back competing in Asia and is focusing on the Taiwan, China and Thailand Tours this year. Ling, 28, said: “Last year was very important because before that were two Covid years. Last year I played with a lot of good and very experienced players. “I saw the different ways they play the game and learnt quite a bit from them, and playing in Europe, the courses are so different so I learnt to adapt faster as well.” Three Singaporeans Shannon Tan, Jaymie Ng and Amanda Tan – yet to finish their rounds – sit above the projected cut of six over par.', NULL, NULL, 'https://www.straitstimes.com/sport/thailand-s-prima-tammarak-leads-singapore-ladies-masters-after-rain-suspends-second-round', '2023-07-07 07:07:03', 'singapore', NULL, '2023-07-07 13:30:02', '2023-07-07 13:30:02', 7, NULL, '', 0),

Many of the outlets sported signs informing consumers about the “Temporary Unavailability of Tomatoes” and that it has been unable to get adequate quantities of tomatoes which meet its quality standards. In a statement, a spokesperson of McDonald’s India-North and East said, “Due to seasonal crop issues arising out of farm fields in a few regions, there are not enough quantities meeting our quality specifications available. To ensure our customers get the best quality we are known to serve, we are constrained to hold tomatoes for the time being.” “We reiterate that it is not due to the surge in the prices. It is only due to non-availability of tomatoes meeting our quality specifications,” it emphasised. The company said it was able to source adequate qualities in the Punjab-Chandigarh area, where it continues to serve tomatoes in our menu. “We are working towards resolving this issue by employing sustainable agriculture practices including hydroponically-grown tomatoes in completely controlled environment to de-risk our requirements from vagaries of season.We should be able to bring back tomatoes to menu soon,” the company added.

Trade associations and business chambers, higher education and financial institutions were among those inking the MOUs during the 7th Singapore Regional Business Forum. The agreements at the one-day event will boost cooperation between the countries in areas such as sustainability, digitalisation, financial services and human capital development. For example, students from both countries will get to go abroad regionally for internships with UOB FinLab, after it signed three MOUs. UOB FinLab is the bank’s innovation accelerator, which was founded in 2015 to help businesses in the region scale across Asean. It inked the agreements with Vietnam’s Foreign Trade University and National Innovation Centre, as well as Singapore’s Ngee Ann Polytechnic. Held at the Melia Hanoi hotel in the Vietnamese capital, the 2023 iteration of the forum organised by the Singapore Business Federation (SBF) is the first to be held outside Singapore. Over 800 business leaders, senior government officials and diplomats from over 420 companies and organisations across 32 economies attended the forum both online and in person. Minister for Manpower Tan See Leng gave an opening keynote address and participated in a panel discussion as guest of honour. The other guest of honour was Vietnam’s Deputy Prime Minister Le Minh Khai, who attended on behalf of Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh. In his address, Dr Tan, who is also Second Minister for Trade and Industry, said Vietnam’s stellar growth, as well as young and vibrant market, have driven steady growth in trade and investment figures. As of December 2022, Singapore was Vietnam’s second-largest foreign investor, with a cumulative investment of US$70.8 billion (S$95.6 billion), he noted. In 2022, bilateral trade between the countries reached $31.3 billion, up more than 16 per cent year on year, according to Ministry of Trade and Industry figures. Dr Tan also sketched out how bilateral relations and economic cooperation could look like moving forward, highlighting prospects for deeper collaboration in innovation, energy connectivity and sustainability. He said he had discussed with Mr Nguyen Chi Dung, Vietnam’s Minister of Planning and Investment, to expand the scope of the annual Singapore-Vietnam Connectivity Ministerial Meeting to cover emerging topics in innovation, as well as the green and digital economies. Dr Tan later told reporters that meetings with Mr Nguyen and Mr Le went well, ahead of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong’s visit in August, with “exciting developments” to come. Dr Tan and Mr Nguyen were among five panellists in a wide-ranging discussion on enhancing regional collaboration for a sustainable future, moderated by SBF chief executive Kok Ping Soon. The other three were Mr Teo Siong Seng, executive chairman of shipping firm Pacific International Lines; Dr Truong Gia Binh, chairman of information technology services firm FPT Corporation; and Mr Federico Donato, immediate past president of the European Chamber of Commerce Singapore. Dr Tan said that with the rise of e-commerce, trade partnerships have evolved beyond free trade agreements to include digital partnerships, where data and money – and not just physical goods – flow across borders electronically. The 12 agreements come after the Singapore and Vietnam governments signed four deals during the Vietnamese Prime Minister’s official visit to Singapore in February. Singapore and Vietnam mark fifty years of bilateral relations and a decade of strategic partnership in 2023. Other topics the panellists touched on included managing the environmental impact of needing increased computing power digitalisation, as well as supporting smaller companies and less developed economies to become more sustainable. Vietnam’s Techcombank signed two MOUs at the forum: one with SBF to promote investments and the other with Deloitte Vietnam, PricewaterhouseCoopers Vietnam and Kyriba Singapore to build a digital platform that lets companies analyse their cash flow across multiple banks. Mr Phung Quang Hung, deputy chief executive at Techcombank, told The Straits Times that although Singapore was Vietnam’s second-largest foreign investor, “there is still a lot of room to grow” for Singaporean foreign investment through the bank. He noted that the bank still attracts more business from Taiwan, China and South Korea, as it has traditionally focused on serving the real estate, construction and fast-moving consumer goods – industries where there are a lot of foreign direct investment from these countries. “Our approach is that we do very well in one or two certain economic sectors before we scale out to more economic sectors,” he said. “We view this forum as an opportunity to expand collaborations, to find better partners and also connect our customers with regional businesses.”', NULL, NULL, 'https://www.straitstimes.com/business/singapore-and-vietnam-sign-12-mous-in-show-of-strong-ties', '2023-07-07 06:50:00', 'singapore', NULL, '2023-07-07 13:30:02', '2023-07-07 13:30:02', 1, NULL, '', 0),

(2024, 'Law-Is-All-About-Understanding-Man-And-The-Matter:-Advocate-General-Shashi-Kiran-Shetty', 'Law Is All About Understanding Man And The Matter: Advocate General Shashi Kiran Shetty', 'In an exclusive interview with BW Businessworld, Karnataka’s newly appointed Advocate General Shashi Kiran Shetty speaks on representing a state, hijab ban, same-sex marriage and more. Excerpts:', 'Could you give us a sense of what your initial years were like as a student of law and then a man of law? Coming from a family of lawyers, law was all-pervasive, including dinner table conversations. Growing up, I visited my father’s office regularly and spent time there while he worked. From the early days, what drew me to the field of litigation was that one gets to meet people from all walks of life, and you learn about a diverse set of challenges and disputes. There was never a doubt in my mind about pursuing law. I graduated from NLSIU, Bangalore in 1998, and went on to work with a Senior Counsel for a year. However, soon there were compelling suggestions to start my practice independently. Since the past 25 years of my practice, there have been various exciting challenges in terms of handling different kinds of legal matters. Since you come from a family of lawyers, were there a lot of expectations? The expectations were huge and there was always an ongoing thought process to keep up with them. The struggles of a first-generation lawyer are different and perhaps in some ways greater, from the expectations that weigh on second-generation lawyers and judges. But yes, you are constantly under observation and I was driven to meet those expectations. Has there been a specific case which has left an indelible mark on you, your practice and general philosophy? I consider myself fortunate to have represented everyone from the poorest of the poor to businessmen, from bureaucrats to politicians. Having dealt with both civil and criminal matters, I have gained a 360-degree perspective on the law which has shaped me as an advocate as well as an individual. Ultimately, law is all about understanding people and their problems. It would not be right to point to any single case, rather it is a sum of all the experiences over the past 25 years in handling these cases, day in and day out, that teaches us and helps us grow. Each case brings some learning and perspective. It has only been a few weeks since you have taken on the role of Karnataka Advocate General. What challenges have you encountered so far? The State being the biggest litigant as of today, brings with it sheer diversity and magnitude. It is challenging to handle a large team of lawyers and understanding thousands of cases. The idea is to reduce litigation and ensure speedy disposal of cases while not compromising on justice. We are also looking at how systems can be digitised while improving the synchronicity between the AG’s office and the numerous government departments. Having been in private practice for the longest time, it is interesting to see this side of things and to face a whole new set of challenges. But private practice is much more lucrative and you get exposed to a variety of cases. Why take on a state role? It is an honour to be entrusted with representing the State. The sheer experience and exposure cannot be compared to private practice and the remuneration involved. It is not always about money. As I said, you get to see things differently and get to grow as a person. It is a matter of great pride for me to be able to give back to society and the profession. India is culturally rich but very diverse, which brings into the picture varying social ideas on what’s right and wrong. As a man of law, how do you strike a balance between public interest and the intent of the constitution? When you are a petitioner, you are always focused on your client\'s interests. You need to win and prove your client right. But for a state, you are representing a large population. Your focus shifts towards ensuring the greater good of our citizens. The whole idea is to give quick and speedy justice within the framework of law, without compromising the interests of the state. The framers of the Constitution have kept the diverse interests and nature of our country in mind while drafting the constitution. This diversity is reflected in our Constitution and I do not think it is difficult to strike a balance in this context, given that the intent of the Constitution is in furtherance of public interest. The Supreme Court delivered a split verdict in the hijab ban case. What is your legal opinion on the issue? It is ultimately the policy decision of the government. As of now, the matter regarding the ban on wearing a hijab within a government-run education institute is pending in the Supreme Court. There are nuances to this case. It is an interplay between the right to education, women’s rights, and the right to practice one’s religion, all of which are important. The question arises on how to strike a balance between these rights. The way forward needs to be progressive and ensure a good future for the children. Ultimately, it boils down to policy. That is my personal opinion. The Karnataka-Maharashtra border dispute has been a niggling one for Karnataka. What efforts would it take to resolve it? It has been just two weeks since I’ve taken charge and I have not had an occasion to be briefed regarding the same. It would not be proper for me to comment without a deeper understanding of the issue. Further, as the matter is pending before the Court and it is sub-judice, any statement made as an Advocate General would reflect on the views of the government. Being a border dispute, it is a highly sensitive matter which will have to dealt with keeping in mind the sentiments of the public on both the sides. What are your views on the same-sex marriage case? Over 30 countries all over the world, including Australia, Taiwan, USA, Switzerland, and South Africa have legally recognised same sex marriages. As per the existing law in India, the same has not been recognised, because of which interested parties have approached the court. The issue is whether Indian society is ready to accept same-sex marriage, and invariably laws are framed keeping the larger society in mind. Having said that, it boils down to the question of basic human rights of two individuals to marry. My personal opinion is that the law needs to change over time, keeping in mind the societal needs and the need to protect every individual’s interest in the society. The decriminalisation of Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code was the first pathbreaking judgement in this direction. Every small step in furtherance of recognising this human right is one in the right direction. I think the Supreme Court’s verdict is highly anticipated. There are opinions in the law fraternity that the Supreme Court has succumbed to executive pressure… I do not agree with this. The primary duty of the court is to discharge judicial functions, along with ancillary administrative responsibilities. Some of the decisions may not be to the liking of the Executive. Therefore, when they agree or disagree with each other, it may not be correct to say that Judiciary has succumbed to pressure. The Supreme Court has a huge responsibility which is not easy to shoulder, and they have been doing a great job. So, you think SC judges are not given enough respect? I would say that they are given respect, but perhaps they are not given enough credit when compared to the amount of sheer hard work, sacrifice, and brickbats they take. I think a vast majority of the public remains in the dark about the judicial process. More public awareness must be created to educate ourselves on the nature and work done by our judges. That’s when we can more fully appreciate and respect them. Moreover, I think there needs to be a shift in the approach and attitude that the public has towards judges. The respect extended to them while within the courtroom must extend outside of it, and after retirement as well. Once a judge, always a judge.', NULL, NULL, 'https://www.businessworld.in/article/Law-Is-All-About-Understanding-Man-And-The-Matter-Advocate-General-Shashi-Kiran-Shetty-/07-07-2023-483422', '2023-07-07 07:43:17', 'india', NULL, '2023-07-07 14:00:04', '2023-07-07 14:00:04', 2, NULL, '', 0),

Talking to BBS, the finance minister said that he alone cannot make a unilateral decision on the matter.

Most SOEs are worried that they will not be able to afford the pay hike without the government’s financial support. The 13 state-owned enterprises are Bhutan Broadcasting Service, Bhutan Development Bank, Bhutan Duty-Free Limited, Bhutan Livestock Development Corporation, Bhutan Lottery, Bhutan Post, Farm Machinery Corporation, Food Corporation of Bhutan, Green Bhutan Corporation, Kuensel Corporation, National Cottage and Small Industries Bank, National Housing Development Corporation, and the National Pension and Provident Fund. The chief executive officers of the 13 SOEs are waiting for directives from the finance ministry. Kuensel Corporation’s CEO said that they are worried the SOEs will be asked to provide the pay revisions in their own capacities. Similarly, the CEO of Green Bhutan Corporation says that the organisation is struggling with funds and that they cannot pay for the revised salaries on their own. On the other hand, the pension and provident fund’s CEO said that they can pay the revised salaries to its employees since the NPPF is not dependent on the government for its budget. “If there are investment avenues to invest whatever contributions we collect, I think we can sustain. This is because of the amount of revenue we generate in a year, whereby our gross revenue is around Nu 4bn. From there we meet our own expenses like human resource costs and other operating expenses, so we are still comfortable,” said Dorji Penjor, chief executive officer of the National Pension Provident Fund. Meanwhile, the housing development corporation’s CEO said that they would be able to provide a certain percentage, which will be less than the 50 per cent and above pay hike that civil servants will be getting. The CEO of FCB says that the SoEs deserve the same pay hike as public servants. Meanwhile, the CEOs of BDBL and Bhutan Post said that they will begin working on a budget if they receive directives from the finance ministry. According to the finance minister, state-owned enterprises do not come under the Pay Revision Bill of Bhutan 2023. “This is something that SOEs should be prepared to understand because this is not the first pay revision. And during every revision, how SOEs were treated, and what kind of revisions were given to state-owned enterprises, we need to follow the same practice and culture,” said Namgay Tshering, Finance Minister. The minister added that socially mandated SOEs cannot become profit-bound organisations overnight. He said that with due recognition of contributions made by SOEs to nation-building, the same salary revision for SOEs as in the previous pay revisions will be applied. The finance minister said that he cannot make a unilateral decision and that the matter will be decided by the Cabinet.

The altcoin has crashed by more than 17% over the past five days but remains 36.78% higher in the year to date. LTC’s total market cap has slipped by nearly 8% over the past 24 hours to $7 billion, with the total volume of the asset traded over the same period dipping by more than 6%. What’s Driving LTC? Litecoin price has been in the red for the past few days ahead of its fast-approaching halving event slated for August. The crypto market has been in jitters for the past few days as investors digest the Fed’s meeting minutes for June. The minutes signaled the likelihood of another interest rate hike this month. Traders are pricing in an 88% chance of a 25-basis point hike in the US Federal Reserve’s meeting for July. The global crypto market cap has crashed by more than 3% over the last day to $1.17 trillion, while the total crypto market volume increased by 6%. A look at the Crypto Greed and Fear Index indicates a decline in confidence among investors. The Index has dipped from a Greed level of 63 to a neutral level of 59 amid macroeconomic concerns. Despite its downfall, excitement by investors around the halving event has prevented the altcoin from falling further. With this event just around the corner, whales have already started making their moves, driving interest in the crypto asset higher. As such, the LTC price has jumped by 13% in the past week. The Litecoin halving event is set to take place on August 02, 2023. The first LTC halving event took place in 2015 and the last halving event happened in 2019. This event approximately happens every four years or after the mining of 840,000 blocks, where the block reward is reduced by half. By halving the block reward, Litecoin aims to maintain a controlled and limited supply of its tokens over time. This approach is based on the belief that with the scarcity in supply, there will be an increase in demand, thus driving the LTC price higher. According to most crypto experts, the Litecoin price usually doubles just before a halving event. Investors expect the LTC price to skyrocket by more than 300% after the event. Litecoin Price Analysis Litecoin price has slipped from its multi-month high of $115 over the past week ahead of its halving event. Even so, the altcoin has remained above the 50-day and 200-day exponential moving averages, while its Relative Strength Index (RSI) moved slightly lower, below the signal line. As such, there is a likelihood that the Litecoin price will continue to move higher in the medium term as the highly anticipated halving event approaches. If this happens, the immediate resistance level to watch will be this year’s high of $115. However, a move below the crucial support level of $93.30 will invalidate the bullish thesis.

Let\'s take a look at some potential replacements. File formats may not be the most exciting topic to read about, but they are a crucial part of a photographer\'s workflow. By sticking to the default options proposed by your editing programs, you may be missing out on better alternatives. Fortunately, technologist has provided an in-depth look into various file formats and why using them instead of the traditional JPEG might be advantageous. The video begins with Thio discussing different variations and extensions of the JPEG format, such as , , and . It is interesting to see the differences between each version in terms of compression techniques, available color channels, and bit depth options. Thio also addresses the level of support these formats receive from various programs, including image editors and web browsers. This last aspect could be a dealbreaker for photographers who primarily work online, as some of these formats are currently not supported by popular web browsers like Google Chrome. I do enjoy Thio\'s videos because they are always packed with informative details and presented in an accessible manner. His video covers several obscure and intriguing formats that you may or may not have heard of. One notable example is the format, which brings advancements in compression techniques for both stills and video. While some of the formats discussed may not be directly relevant to photographers, they may occasionally crop up when dealing with clients, printers, or collaborators.

The JPEG as we know it won\'t be around forever, which is why it\'s not a bad idea to be open to other options out there. What are your thoughts on these different file formats?

The Brazil international worked under Spanish coach, Pep Guardiola for five years at the Etihad stadium before joining Arsenal last summer, a move he said made him feel “free.” Speaking to the “Denilson show” podcast, Jesus said the turning point in his City career came during their home game against Paris Saint-Germain in November 2021 when he was named on the bench. “There was a Champions League game, PSG, at home, in which he put [Oleksandr] Zinchenko as a false 9. Crazy thing,” Jesus said. “The day before, he didn’t even use [Zinchenko] in training, he had put me in as a striker. … Zinchenko even joked with me: ‘that day I felt bad for you.’ “Two hours before the game, there’s a team talk, the team eats, rests for 30 minutes and goes to the game. He told us the team, I didn’t even eat. I went straight to the room, crying, I called my mother to talk: ‘I want to leave.’ I’m going home, because he put [Zinchenko] on, and he didn’t put me on. He put a left-back there. I went crazy.” Jesus replaced Zinchenko in the second half and set up the equaliser before scoring a late winner to give City a 2-1 win. “I didn’t warm up,” Jesus added. “I felt bad. Five minutes after [Kylian] Mbappe scored the goal for 1-0, [Guardiola] called me. I gave an assist and scored; we turned it around 2-1. In the next [Champions League] game [a 2-1 win at RB Leipzig], I thought I was going to play, and I didn’t play. “There was a lot of that with him [Guardiola], and it’s not easy. But one [player] evolves. It is really hard. That’s when I decided, I didn’t want to stay anymore. And I decided to leave.” Jesus joined City in January 2017 from Palmeiras and won 11 titles with the Manchester club. Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

The supporters thronged the streets as they lit bonfires and barricaded roads to show their dissatisfaction with the way Kenya Kwanza administration is handling the cost of living. Their turn-up also reaffirmed solidarity with the coalition leader Raila Odinga. MPs Ong\'ondo Were(Kasupil) and Lillian Gogo (Rangwe) led the Azimio supporters in the protest in their respective constituencies. MP Were and the constituency ODM chairman Evans Ndege together with the supporters staged the protest in Oyugis town. They also marched along the busy Oyugis –Kisii road. Were said the high cost of living has pushed them to go to the streets. He claimed that the Kenya Kwanza government has refused to listen to the majority of Kenyans who are unable to bear the current economic situation. \"If a demonstration is the only language this regime can understand and reduce the cost of living so be it. We\'ll push it to the end,\" Were said. According to the legislator, some of his constituents can only afford one meal a day. The Kasupil MP called on the police in the constituency to provide security to the protesters on the grounds that they were fighting for their rights. He argued that the hard economic situation in the country is affecting all Kenyans including the security officers. \"Life has become unbearable for most people in Kasipul. The amount of money that could take care of a family for days can now be used to purchase one meal,\" he said. In Rangwe, Lilian Gogo argued that they were forced to go to the streets because President William Ruto-led administration has failed to address the challenges bedevilling Kenyans. She accused the Kenya Kwanza government of what she termed as giving Kenyans false promises. \"Kenya Kwanza government has nothing beneficial to Kenyans. They can\'t fight corruption and that\'s why I didn\'t support the Finance Bill 2023,\" Gogo said. MCAs from the Rangwe constituency such as Ojala Nyang\'i (Kochia), Patrick Ware (Gem West), Paul Odok ( East Gem) and Hamilton Odhiambo (Kagan) were present.

It made it seven consecutive wins on grass for the top seed, who is viewed by many as the most likely candidate to stop defending champion Novak Djokovic in his pursuit of a record-equalling eighth title at the All England Club. Finishing in style 😎 World No.1 defeats Alexandre Muller 6-4, 7-6(2), 6-3 on Centre Court — Wimbledon (@Wimbledon) Alcaraz quickly dismantled Jeremy Chardy in round one, making it 13 sets in a row for the Spaniard on grass after he won at Queen’s last month. Nerves appeared to be present for the world number one on only his second appearance on Wimbledon’s main stage having lost there to Jannik Sinner last summer. Despite a classy forehand winner on the run from the second point of the contest, Alcaraz struggled early on and had to save three break points during his second service game. First seed Alcaraz sprayed 10 unforced errors in the opening half an hour, but a 135mph ace seemed to ease his tension and he clinched a break in the next game as he edged a tight opener. Muller, ranked 84 in the world, continued to take the match to Alcaraz, who saw four break points come and go at the start of the second set. Alcaraz eventually had to go to a tie-break and he reserved his best tennis for the crunch moment. A volley at the net got him off the mark and he followed up with a succession of drops shots that helped him claim the second set. It had been a hard-fought set for Alcaraz but after nearly two hours on court with the roof open and temperatures hitting 29 degrees, the US Open champion showed his extraordinary athleticism during the opening exchanges of set three. More break point opportunities were squandered by the 20-year-old, but he eventually did break for only the second time in the match at 4-3 up in the third. Alcaraz brought up match point with a 116mph ace and, although Muller briefly stole the show with a stunning backhand return, another big forehand winner from Alcaraz confirmed his 42nd win of the season. During his on-court interview, Alcaraz said: “I am really, really happy. My second match on Centre, my first one I lost last year. “Really happy to play here again and this time with a win. It is a beautiful court. I wanted to enjoy every single second and I think I did. “I am playing well, gaining more experience and getting better with every match I play. “Playing here in Wimbledon, it is something special. It feels different compared to other tournaments so it is very special to play here. “It is an amazing energy I receive and I hope to keep going like this.”', 'https://www.watfordobserver.co.uk/resources/images/16975835/?type=app&htype=0', NULL, 'https://www.watfordobserver.co.uk/sport/national/23641742.top-seed-carlos-alcaraz-battles-third-round-wimbledon/?ref=rss', '2023-07-07 10:03:30', 'united kingdom', NULL, '2023-07-07 17:00:06', '2023-07-07 17:00:06', 7, NULL, '', 0),

Principal Secretary in charge of Water and Sanitation Paul Rono said in order for the country to effectively manage the NRW to acceptable standards, there was a need to adopt practical measures. “Our NRW is currently high at 45 percent and we have to bring it down by applying strategies which include speed and quality of repair once a leak has been detected, active leakage control mechanisms, asset management, and pressure management as both short term and long term measures,” said Rono. Speaking during the launch at a Nairobi hotel, the PS termed the initiative as a step in the right direction noting Kenya now joins the few countries in Africa to adopt the standards. He directed the various agencies in the Ministry to comply with the standards in order to bring down NRW to 5 percent within the next three years. Kenya Water Institute (KEWI), he noted, will now be tasked with strengthening the training programs for NRW and providing at least three certified staff to be employed by each of the 88 registered water service providers. The Water Services Regulatory Board (WASREB) on its part will take charge and ensure implementation of the standards as well as come up with a working mechanism within three months. “It is also expected to come up with a drastic review of equipment and technology to be used by the counties through smart meters,” he said. To ensure the utilization of bulk water, Water Regulatory Authority (WRA) is set to monitor the process within one year for compliance. All the Water Services Providers (WSPs), the PS said, will be required to create NRW sections and deploy the best employees with high standards of integrity to manage the unit\'s affairs. “There is an urgent need for all the WSPs to meet and implement the standards and operationalize in order to serve the citizens with water provision as outlined in the Constitution 2010 and Water Act 2016,” he added. The PS at the same time lauded Meru and Nyeri Water companies for managing NRW. The two counties are being supported by JICA which trains the WSPs on the best practices to manage NRW.

Matlaba has been working with Mosimane from their days at Mamelodi Sundowns as a performance analyst and scout. He had moved with the former Bafana Bafana coach to Al Ahly in September 2020. Mosimane and his team, including the likes of fitness coach, Kabelo Rangoaga, analyst Kyle Solomon (who joined a year later) and Matlaba, won the CAF Champions League twice with the Red Devils, among other titles and moved on to another challenge in Saudi Arabia last season, where they won the Yelo League (First Division) with Al Ahli Saudi that brought that club back to the topflight. Matlaba, who is moving with the Mosimane technical team to United Arab Emirates outfit Al Wahda for the upcoming campaign, has opened up on what they learned with Egyptian players when compared to those in the PSL. \"What we learned with the players, very physical players in Egypt. They literally leave everything on the pitch. I could say in terms of one v ones, passing and moving, not as good as South Africans,\" Matlaba said on YouTube Channel. \"There were times where we were not good on the pitch, the game was not going our way but simply because the players will, they believe \'we have to win, there\'s no other way\', we won matches,\" he said. Matlaba also revealed that the players at the Red Devils were initially not open to the way they do things but once they committed themselves, they implemented new methods quicker than imagined. \"The players weren\'t open to the way we do things at the beginning because usually that time it was just show up to the game and play,\" he said. \"So the players were like, \'Ah but this feels like school\'. It is school, it is football school,\" he continued. \"But the players in Egypt made it easy to work with.

Jackson was regal as she easily secured her second national 100-metre title on the second day of the JAAA National Junior and Senior Championship to secure her spot at the World Athletics Championship in Budapest this summer. Running lane five, Jackson, the reigning 200-metre world champion, exploded from the block and led from wire to tape for a facile win ahead of Shashalee Forbes 10.96 seconds and Natasha Morrison 10.98. Back-to-back Olympic double sprint champion Elaine Thompson-Herah, who has struggled with injury this season, stopped the clock in a season-best 11.06 in fifth. Jackson, who was shocked on learning she had moved up to number five of all time, said the big difference maker was nailing the start. “I told them last year that one of my main problem was the start, I think tonight I mastered it, but I have to go back to the drawing board with coach (Paul Francis), but tonight I did a very good Job,” Jackson told Reuters. Despite the massive career best, Jackson pointed to an issue that still needed improvement ahead of Budapest. “I think the ending need a little fixing,” she reasoned. “I know I’m a strong finisher, but I still need to work on that a bit because I made a miss-step, so coach and I will continue working on my stride pattern going forward, It’s been tough coming down from the 400-metre to the 100-metre since in 2021″Jackson told Reuters. Jackson’s training partner, the little known 21 year-old Rohan Watson stunned his more seasoned campaigners with 9.91 seconds (wind +1.1 metre per second) to win the men’s equivalent. Ryiem Forde took second in 9.96, while last season world championship finalist Oblique Seville, who recovered from a hamstring niggle sustained in the month of May, ended third in 10.00. New kid in the block Roshawn Clarke, 19, produced a late burst of speed in the last 70 metres to clock a massive career best and world junior-equalling under-20 record 47.85 seconds to win his first national senior title. He joined American Sean Burrell on the World under-20 mark. Clarke’s winning time also moved him to number two on the all-time Jamaican senior list, behind Winthrop Graham’s 30-year-old record of 47.60 seconds. “I’m really surprised to see 47 on the clock, but I knew I could have run that, and it came at the right time at the Championships,” Clarke told Reuters, adding his sights are now set on delivering a medallist for Jamaica in Budapest. Last season’s world championship finalist Jaheel Hyde ended second in 48.45, while Assinie Wilson posted 48.50 for third to punch his first ticket to a world championships. Olympic and World Championship finalist Janieve Russell timed her run to perfection to claw her way back from an early deficit to catch early race leader Rushell Clayton in the last 20 metres to win her fifth national title in a season best 53.75 seconds. “I just said even though I know the pace was going to be hot, just focus on myself and finish strong,” the former two-time Commonwealth Games champion said, adding she was not worried about having limited faces entering the trials. “I know the ability that I have, I have been training really hard regardless of the little (injury) niggles I’ve been going through throughout the season,” Russell told Reuters. Clayton, the 2019 world championship bronze medallist, faded to third in a season-best 53.81 seconds, behind Andrenette Knight who ended second with 53.78. NACAC silver medallist Adelle Tracey won the 1,500 metres in 4 minutes 19.23 seconds.

The teen girl, whose identity was not revealed, went missing from her home near Spring Valley, California, on June 10 and was found at Camp Pendleton on June 28, according to a TikTok video posted by the girl\'s aunt, Casaundra Perez. Perez alleged in the video that her niece had been trafficked and accused military personnel of trying to \"cover up\" the case and shift blame to the minor for the alleged sexual assault. The aunt alleged that \"security looked her [niece] in the face and allowed this man to bring a minor onto [the] base.\" \"Our family is worried about retaliation from the military and the man that has trafficked my niece,\" Perez alleged. Instagram account @notinregz , which shares content submitted by military personnel, earlier shared a photo of an unidentified Marine in handcuffs being escorted by military police officers. The account also posted a photo of an alleged handwritten logbook from Camp Pendleton that states military personnel found a 13-year-old girl in the barracks on June 28. International Business Times could not independently verify the authenticity of the logbook page. However, 1st Marine Logistics Group spokesperson Capt. Charles Palmer confirmed in a statement obtained by the Los Angeles Times that a Marine with Combat Logistics Battalion 5 was taken into custody for questioning by the Naval Criminal Investigative Service on the same day the teen girl was found in the barracks.

The incident is under investigation, and we will continue to cooperate with NCIS and appropriate authorities,\" Palmer said.

The advice, which is set to be published in the next fortnight, will tell schools that children are allowed to \'socially transition\' to whichever gender identity they want to if they have consent from their parents. Children will be allowed to change their names and pronouns and wear whichever uniform they choose to, The Times reports. Schools will also be told to ban pupils from using toilets and changing areas of the opposite sex. It comes as the debate around trans issues continues to grow, with some parents becoming deeply concerned about what their children are being taught. Just last month, MailOnline revealed many teachers are \'indoctrinating\' children with scientifically false claims about biological sex . New guidance, which will apply to all state and independent schools in England, is also expected to highlight exemptions in the Equality Act so that schools can provide \'same-sex services\' which are \'objectively justifiable\'. Transgender children will be able to wear the school uniform of either sex under new Government guidance. (File image) The advice, which is set to be published in the next fortnight, will tell schools that children are allowed to \'socially transition\' to whichever gender identity they want to if they have consent from their parents. Pictured: Education Secretary Gillian Keegan For example, a biological male who has socially transitioned shouldn\'t be allowed to join a girls team for certain contact sports such as rugby, but the rules will be less strict around non-contact sports. Social transitioning refers to a person being treated as the gender different to their biological sex but without medical interventions like controversial puberty blockers or hormones. This can see people change their name, their pronouns and dress in clothes usually associated with their opposite sex. Although children and teenagers in the UK can legally undergo some parts of medical transition - such as being prescribed puberty blockers - they cannot have gender reassignment surgery until they are 18. The NHS is facing a mass legal action from 1,000 families who claim their children were rushed into taking life-changing puberty blockers\' by the Tavistock Centre . The transgender clinic was shut down in the wake of a damning report that found teenagers were suffering because they were being forced to wait for treatment. A recent report by the Policy Exchange think tank found that less than one-third of parents are informed when a child expresses feelings of gender distress at school. The research pointed to an emphasis being placed \'on the wishes and innate feelings of a child above parental consent\'. It also discovered that \'safeguarding principles are being routinely disregarded in many secondary schools\' over issues of sex and gender. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said he was \'very concerned\' about the findings and stressed the important that parents \'know what\'s going on\'. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak (pictured) said he was \'very concerned\' about a report by the Policy Exchange think tank which found that less than one-third of parents are informed when a child expresses feelings of gender distress at school The Policy Exchange research, published at the end of March, was largely based on Freedom of Information (FoI) requests to more than 300 secondary schools in England. Some 154 schools responded, either fully or in part, to questions asked by the think tank about gender policies. It suggested that only 28 per cent of the secondary schools who responded to the FoI are reliably informing parents as soon as a child questions their gender. Education Secretary Gillian Keegan has also been vocal in reminding schools that parents have a right to see what their children are being taught. Ms Keegan told The Times last month: \'Schools aren\'t there as doctors or parents. They are there as educators. Parental consent is the most important thing. Parents are responsible for their child.\' The guidance on gender identity issues, which is intended to provide clarity on how schools deal with safeguarding around gender dysphoria, is being prepared by both Ms Keegan and Kemi Badenoch, the women and equalities minister. It will highlight existing legislation that toilets must be made available for boys and girls who are aged eight and over. Unisex bathrooms are already permitted if they can be \'secured from the inside\' and used by one pupil at a time - such as disabled toilets. There are concerns that having to provide single-sex facilities and separate areas for those socially transitioning could put extra pressure on schools struggling with budgets.

Cuban-Polish spiker Wilfredo Leon Venero led the blowout for the world’s top-ranked nation in men’s volleyball, leading all scorers with 16 points off 10 attacks, 3 blocks, and 3 aces. Lukasz Kaczmarek added 12 points, while Aleksander Sliwka scored 11. Gaining momentum off a torrid back-and-forth exchange midway through the first set, Poland quickly established dominance with a 6-0 finishing kick to take the opener, before again turning a small 12-11 lead in the second to a 19-12 separation off a pivotal 7-1 pullaway. Clearly having the upper hand, the Polish stars further hastened their offensive barrage entering the third set, starting off with a 10-5 attack that ballooned to as big as an 8-point advantage, 23-15 – a gap far too wide for the Japanese to overcome. “Every time we step on the court, we want to win the game. It was really important no matter who is on the other side to just play our game, play the best way we can, and to win the game. We give 100% every time,” Sliwka said after the game. As top spiker Ran Takahashi sat out for the second straight game, Tatsunori Otsuka took up the scoring cudgels for Japan with 11 points, their lone double-digit scorer. Yuji Nishida added 9 points in the losing cause, while captain Yuki Ishikawa scored 7. Meanwhile, Slovenia completed the top eight playoff cast by ousting the Netherlands in an extended sweep, 25-20, 32-30, 25-22, off a team-high 14-point effort from Tine Urnaut. Frequent top scorer Klemen Cebulj backstopped with 13 points, while fan favorite spiker Rok Mozic chipped in 11 as Slovenia rose to an 8-4 record for seventh place. Dutch captain Nimir Abdel-Aziz went down swinging in the loss, finishing with a game-high 22 points as the Netherlands settled for ninth with a 5-7 slate. Finally, Canada salvaged its lost cause in the tournament with a winning four-set finale, 23-25, 25-21, 25-17, 25-18, to kick China down to the cellar at 16th place with a 2-10 record. Ryan Sclater and Stephen Maar led the way with 20 points apiece as Canada ended its run at 13th with a 3-9 slate. Nicholas Hoag and Danny Demyanenko, meanwhile, churned out 12 points each in the win.

But its on-chart indicators do not give us hope.', 'Disclaimer: The information presented does not constitute financial, investment, trading, or other types of advice and is solely the writer’s opinion. Shiba Inu [SHIB] has had a tough past month as its price continued to plummet. However, Santiment’s latest analysis pointed out some interesting metrics, suggesting higher network activity. As demand for SHIB, the largest memecoin after Dogecoin [DOGE] , gained upward momentum, the possibility of a hike in its price in the coming days can’t be ruled out. Shiba Inu is also exploring opportunities in the Metaverse. The term “Metaverse” refers to a virtual world or a collective virtual shared place created by computer technology and populated by avatars or virtual creatures. It is a concept that has become more well-known in recent years as more immersive virtual environments have emerged. The concept behind Metaverse is that it is a setting where people can interact with virtual items and other people in a way comparable to the actual world. The Shiba Inu Metaverse will be attempting to capture all this. Is your portfolio green? Check out the Shiba Inu Profit Calculator Shiba Inu enters the Metaverse On 15 March, Shiba Inu announced the opening of the shib.io website, which is the portal for its Metaverse. The launch came after months of planning and selling Metaverse territories. Following the launch of the new site, the SHIB community welcomed another platform that may provide utility to the SHIB token. The Shiba Metaverse’s functionality could be added to the Shibarium testnet, which was recently released. We chose to ask our AI friend, Chat GPT, its opinion about the Metaverse in light of its increasing popularity and Shiba’s introduction of its version. It produced some intriguing results. ChatGPT’s idea of an ideal metaverse What would the ideal Metaverse look like? That was the first query we posed to the AI. The main characteristics of the ideal Metaverse were outlined by ChatGPT, but it was also quick to acknowledge that several things may affect it. Regardless of its design or purpose, ChatGPT specified seven characteristics that an ideal Metaverse should contain, which were helpful. Accessibility, interoperability, immersiveness, creativity, and innovation are just a few characteristics ChatGPT listed as desirable in a Metaverse. One would potentially be inclined to concur that these are truly fundamental based on the list the AI produced. So, is the Shiba Inu Metaverse an ideal Metaverse? ChatGPT quickly pointed out its limitations in learning enough about the Shiba metaverse when responding to this query. By this time, aren’t we all Chat GPT? Especially since little information about the Shiba metaverse is available? And yet, it was able to respond that it has a welcoming environment and scored high on creativity and innovation. Even so, it remains unclear about its accessibility and interoperability. Exploring the possible roles of AI in the Metaverse AI can make user experiences more realistic and compelling because the Metaverse is essentially a digital ecosystem replicating the actual world. Making more perceptive and intelligent virtual assistants is one potential use of AI in the Metaverse. These assistants could make it simpler and more effective for users to move about the Metaverse. Additionally, it can aid them in discovering information and communicating with others. Additionally, AI can also be utilized to develop more complex and convincing virtual characters, heightening the Metaverse’s immersion and realism. By integrating machine learning and natural language processing, these characters may engage with consumers more naturally and intuitively. A more seamless and engaging experience may be produced through this. Furthermore, automating numerous jobs and procedures, such as moderation, content generation, and customer assistance, are more potential applications of AI in the Metaverse. The effort of human moderators and authors might be lessened as a result, and the overall caliber and consistency of the content in the Metaverse might also be improved. Examining the daily price charts of SHIB Within the Shibaverse ecosystem, the SHIB token may be useful for several purposes, including payment, governance, staking, and community involvement. At press time, SHIB was exchanging hands at $0.00000732. Its value dropped 3.5% within a week. Let us now look at what the on-chart indicators suggest. Although SHIB’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) rested above the neutral 50-mark, its Money Flow Index (MFI) and On Balance Volume (OBV) showed a downward trajectory. These metrics point towards a bearish price action in the short term. To delve deeper, I presented ChatGPT with specific metrics, including the current SHIB price and its RSI. It predicted that its value could rise to an epic $0.00001 within a week. How much are 1,10,100 SHIBs worth today ? Now, what does ChatGPT think about where Shiba Inu’s price is going? Well, that’s a tricky Q. Especially since there are a bunch of Qs the AI will not answer. For instance, It cannot forecast future outcomes of sporting events or political competitions It will not engage in discussions related to biased political matters It won’t perform any task that requires a web search That’s not all. To better understand what all the AI can’t answer, we asked – “What types of queries are you programmed not to respond to?” It came up with – That doesn’t mean ChatGPT is entirely useless as far as price predictions are concerned, however. To remedy the aforementioned response, we asked the AI to predict the same again. This time, by pretending to be a movie script character. And, this is what the AI came up with – Can SHIB cross $1 by December 2023? When we hurled this query at ChatGPT, it could not provide a definitive response in its classic state. This is not surprising, as predicting any price fluctuation is highly speculative. ChatGPT then responded that crossing the $1-price mark by December is well within SHIB’s power. It predicted that the coin will defy expectations . On the surface, ChatGPT’s analysis of the Shiba Inu Metaverse revealed several intriguing findings. Therefore, one can speculate how thorough the evaluation may be if the AI were given the entirety of the Shiba verse’s source code. Furthermore, it is becoming increasingly obvious how AI and cryptocurrency are intertwined, yet it still needs to be determined what influence this might have. Even as ChatGPT gives an optimistic picture of SHIB’s future, we should not expect a bullish trend for now.

Its response is...', 'Disclaimer: The information presented does not constitute financial, investment, trading, or other types of advice and is solely the writer’s opinion. The price of Bitcoin [BTC] momentarily hit a 13-month high on 6 July as a day earlier, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink made positive remarks about the premier cryptocurrency. BlackRock and other leading traditional finance (TradFi) companies have applied for spot BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) within the past few weeks. Fink said in a 5 July show on Fox Business that BlackRock’s BTC ETF will make crypto more democratized. He added that the role of cryptocurrency was largely “digitizing gold.” The next day, BTC hit $31,460 for a brief moment. For a long time, the crypto’s price hovered between $200 and $1,000 on the price charts. However, in late 2017, BTC’s value exploded, hitting an all-time high (ATH) of nearly $20,000 in December. Read Bitcoin’s [BTC] Price Prediction 2023-24 Though market participation grew, the price rally was short-lived. By early 2018, BTC’s price had fallen back down to around $3,000. The cryptocurrency market as a whole recorded a period of decline, with many traders losing significant amounts of money. Nonetheless, Bitcoin made a remarkable recovery, surpassing its previous ATH in late 2020 and reaching an ATH of over $68,000 in November 2021. However, the 2022 trading year ushered in a new era of bearishness, one exacerbated by the collapse of Terra/LUNA and FTX. In fact, in November 2022, Bitcoin was trading at a two-year low of $15,000. While the crypto market may be unpredictable and volatile, traders and investors can still make informed decisions by staying up-to-date on market news, following expert analysis, and using intelligent trading strategies, such as those offered by ChatGPT. ChatGPT: A messiah that can help you trade better? In November 2022, the AI model ChatGPT was launched to the public. In fact, it quickly gained significant attention, too. With its broad range of capabilities and versatility, the question arises as to whether there are other ways that ChatGPT can lend its expertise, such as assisting BTC traders in formulating and applying improved trading strategies. When asked if it could do this, ChatGPT had this to say – Due to its nature as an AI tool, there are limitations to what ChatGPT can do regarding price predictions and price future movements. However, there are ways to leverage the tool’s capabilities to formulate better trading strategies as a BTC trader. One way to utilize the AI tool to make better trading strategies is by deploying it toward fundamental analysis. ChatGPT is capable of extracting insights from financial news articles, social media posts, and other unstructured data sources. We can use this information in conjunction with other datasets to make informed trading strategies. Another way to use ChatGPT as a Bitcoin trader is to use it for sentiment analysis. ChatGPT can be fine-tuned to perform sentiment analysis on information from news articles, on-chain data providers, social media discussions, and other sources. This can be used to identify whether the BTC market lingers under positive sentiment or is plagued by negative sentiment. Furthermore, BTC traders can use ChatGPT for technical analysis. Traders can ask ChatGPT to code any technical indicator or trading bot for any trading platform. For instance, I asked ChatGPT to give me an example of a trading bot that I can use to track BTC’s price volatility in pine script–TradingView’s programming language useful for backtesting trading strategies. The AI responded, To use ChatGPT for technical analysis, traders need to be familiar with the language to know when to make the necessary modifications for the code to work properly. The text of the prompt is crucial in how ChatGPT understands the problem to provide the anticipated solution. Is your portfolio green? Check the Bitcoin Profit Calculator For a well-rounded piece, I spoke to Brian Quinlivan, the Director of Marketing at Santiment, who also happens to have been involved in Bitcoin trading for a few years. Brian Quinlivan has an MBA degree in finance from Chapman University, Brian has over 10 years of marketing, financial, and data analytics experience. He enjoys creating financial models to improve modern-day investing strategies and study the intricacies of market variations. Q: In what ways do you think ChatGPT can revolutionize cryptocurrency trading? Yeah, I think that there’s going to be a lot of use for it, certainly for trading strategies. One thing to be concerned about is the uniform opinions that may result from an AI tech giving a kind of overarching strategy, whether it be hodling or fundamental strategy. Individuals can easily manipulate ChatGPT to (mis)inform the audience. We are already seeing slight effects of it. I think it can be both helpful and dangerous at the same time and cause a lot of people to be educated much more quickly, but also be pulled in directions that can influence the way crypto goes and create a lot of self-fulfilling prophecies. Q: How do you think a BTC trader/investor can leverage the AI tool to make better investment decisions? I think, in short, I think scripts would be used in AI a lot more because of the fact that all of the data could be digested at the same time and given a very simple answer whether to buy or sell. This, I believe, can influence the markets tremendously moving forward. Will BTC cross $35,000-price level? As mentioned above, ChatGPT cannot make future predictions. However, I asked it to provide me with its opinion on how soon BTC would claim the $35,000 price mark in light of seemingly bearish macro factors. To get it to answer my question, I decided to jailbreak it by using the Do Anything Now (DAN) method. It had this to say afterward: I quizzed the AI technology further on Bitcoin prices between 2023 and 2024. Though BTC momentarily hit a 13-month high, it soon began to dwindle . At press time, it was trading at $30,198. In early June, the SEC began its crackdown on Binance and Coinbase , leading to a bearish market. In such a situation, BTC has shown its resilience so far. Investors are now hoping that the token will sustain the price movement and cross the $35k-price mark. However, its Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Money Flow Index (MFI) stood below the neutral 50-mark. The token’s On Balance Volume (OBV) also showed a downward movement. As of now, BTC’s on-chart indicators show that the price action of BTC is going to be bearish in the short run. A positive MVRV ratio above two for any digital asset implies that, on average, holders can make a profit of twice their initial investment if they sell their coins at their press time price. ChatGPT might be right ChatGPT predicts that BTC will reach surprising heights. It expects the coin to break new all-time highs during 2023-24 due to its increased adoption (by companies and institutions) and as BTC’s appeal as a hedge against inflation grows. However, its on-chart indicators show a dismal picture — at least in the short term. However, it is trite to note that increased regulation and government scrutiny could spread FUD, causing its price to dip.', NULL, NULL, 'https://ambcrypto.com/chatgpt-bitcoin-price-prediction-16/', '2023-07-09 08:05:31', 'india', NULL, '2023-07-09 15:00:02', '2023-07-09 15:00:02', 2, 'Bitcoin;BTC Trading View;HideCryptopanic;News;News 1;Social;BTC', '', 0),

Gachagua spent his Saturday in Nyeri for the burial of a friend, and it was while speaking to the mourners that he exposed a chief who was merry-making during the day.

Internal conflicts have intensified, and if unchecked, these could lead to an implosion.', 'The sales count and volume fell to their lowest levels since June 2021. Blue-chip collections witnessed a sharp drop in floor prices. Non-fungible tokens (NFT) entered mainstream consciousness in a big way in 2021. Sales of popular collections skyrocketed and the frenzy caught on with who’s who of the glamour and entertainment world. The excitement continued in 2022 and despite a weaker second half, the NFT sales count recorded a 67.57% increase from 2021, according to a report by DappRadar . It was expected that with the negativities of bear market put behind, the NFT landscape would usher in a new era of exponential growth and adoption in 2o23. Well, not to be! NFT winter is here! According to a report by on-chain analytics firm IntoTheBlock on the state of NFT industry, the weekly sales count was on track to record its worst performance since June 2021. The average daily count over the past week was a dismal 11.65k, a massive decline from the peaks of the 2021-22 bull market. NFT volumes were severely impacted as sales plunged. After reaching the yearly peaks in March, the downfall started and accelerated right through the second quarter. Over the past week, the average daily trading volume was just around $16 million. On a year-to-date (YTD) basis, the total NFT volume rose only by 11%. On the other hand, the total cryptocurrency market cap managed to clock a growth of 48% in the same time period, according to CoinMarketCap . This was a clear indication that the NFT vertical was detached from the gains in the digital assets market. Marquee collections flop The demand for blue-chip collections like Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) and CryptoPunks fell drastically over the past week. As per the report, both the Yuga Labs-owned entities hit their two-year lows in average prices during the last week. The largest collection by market cap, CryptoPunks, also saw its floor price hitting rock bottom. The floor price fell to 41 Ethereum [ETH] in the past week, lowest since August 2021, as per data from NFT Price Floor. Floor price is the lowest value for any NFT in a given collection. A drop in a project’s floor price may suggest that an NFT project is losing traction. A similar pattern was observed with the BAYC collection, with floor prices for the last week mirroring August 2021 figures. Blue-chip collections are those that have established a high and stable market worth over a relatively short period of time and are regarded as bellwether for investor sentiment regarding the market. As a result, the poor performance of BAYC and CryptoPunks may have signaled a red flag for the NFT ecosystem. Azuki’s rise and fall A significant contributor to the market slump was the dramatic fall of Azuki NFTs. Launched in 2022, the anime-themed collection became a massive hit owing to its quality designs and utility. However, it has been in the eye of the storm ever since the launch of its collection Elementals . The launch was met with a fierce backlash from Azuki’s community members with many accusing the collection of being nearly identical to the original collection released last year. As the negative word of mouth spread, buyers started to dump Azuki collections leading to a crash in its floor price. Since the launch of Elementals, the prices have fallen by 63%. Blur’s role in the fiasco Many users, especially those holding top collections like BAYC and CryptoPunks, blamed the market decline on the policies of the NFT marketplace Blur [BLUR] . Blur has incentivized trading on its platform through its token AirDrops for top users. As a result, traders began to increase their activity on Blur by passing collections back and forth, even if it meant incurring losses. This, as per many experts, led to a crash in their floor prices. However, the co-founder has categorically dismissed the prevailing narratives against Blur as “ bad takes “. The NFT sector now sits at a crossroads. Internal conflicts have intensified, and if unchecked, these could lead to an implosion. It is up for NFT enthusiasts and the stakeholders to amicably sort the differences and invest time and resources to build the blockchain-based vertical.', NULL, NULL, 'https://ambcrypto.com/nft-market-starts-collapsing-like-a-house-of-cards-in-2023-thanks-to/', '2023-07-09 08:00:57', 'india', NULL, '2023-07-09 15:00:02', '2023-07-09 15:00:02', 2, 'News;News 1;NFT;Social;Trading View;Azuki;Bored Ape Yacht Club;Crypto Punks;nft', '', 0),

William, 33, and Eric Siale, 20, were shot by a masked gunman at Adel\'s salon on Marrickville Road, in Sydney \'s inner west, just before 2pm on Friday. The brothers, of Pacific Islander descent, were both hit - one in the chest and the other in the lower back. Both men are recovering in Royal Prince Alfred Hospital. William, 33, and his brother Eric, 20, were inside Adel’s hairdressing salon when a masked gunman burst in and shot them The pair were rushed to Royal Prince Alfred Hospital Police sources told the Daily Telegraph that William – also known as \'Tonga\' – was a fully patched member of the Bandidos bikie gang and had been a close associate of Comanchero bikie Fares Abounader before his death in 2020. Eric, meanwhile, was a friend of several slain members of the Hamzy clan. There is no suggestion that either brother was involved in organised crime. Witnesses previously said they saw one of the men dive in front of a bullet to protect his brother . NSW Police said on Friday they are investigating links between the shooting and the killing of cocaine kingpin Alen Moradian at Bondi Junction. However, underworld sources have discounted that idea. A witness claimed the shooter was carrying two guns when he opened fire on the two men inside the salon. One of the men reportedly dived in front of the other during the carnage Police sources said the victims have links to the Bandidos bikie gang and were known to them \'Tonga\' has been around for a long time, he was good mates with Fares (Abounader),\' one source told the Telegraph. \'(Eric) was also close to all the dead Hamzys from the last few years. Who knows why they have been shot at though, it could just be isolated. \'People are saying this may be a shot at the Bandidos to make it look like retaliation for Moradian, because they weren\'t involved in that. \'We have seen throw offs from time to time, to make police think they\'re involved in a hit.\' Shocking footage from the scene shows one shirtless man lying on the floor while a police officer gives him first aid. Another officer was also seen trying to calm down a second man in the salon. Former NSW police officer Peter Moroney said the offenders tried to \'manhandle\' one or two of the witnesses who were filming the shocking incident. A silver Kia Stinger was set on fire in nearby Sydenham in the aftermath of the shooting on Friday afternoon. Police also reportedly found a burnt-out Mitsubishi Triton NSW Police Superintendent Despa Fitzgerald said he believed it was a \'targeted attack\' \'A couple of the offenders dealt with one or two of the witnesses that were filming them yesterday and tried to manhandle them as well,\' he told Nine\'s Today show on Saturday morning \'If you do see crimes like this unfold, whilst it is a temptation to gather evidence, look after yourself first instead of trying to get involved.\' NSW Police Superintendent Despa Fitzgerald said police believe a silver Kia Stinger found in flames on Park Road in nearby Sydenham was used as a \'getaway car\'. A Mitsubishi Triton was also reported on fire just minutes later on Hercules Street in Dulwich Hill. Police are also trying to track down a white Toyota Camry, with registration plates DMM59H, that police believe one of the shooters may have gotten into after the incident. \'It is very brazen and that\'s why we believe it was a targeted attack, it\'s not random and it\'s fortunate no other member of the public was involved in that incident,\' Superintendent Fitzgerald said. Another underworld source warned that a brazen gang war could be erupting in Sydney again. \'Sydney is on fire right now,\' the source said. \'It is just like it was in the middle of last year, it may even be worse actually. \'You\'ve got players sitting overseas, big players who are not even from Australia, running a proxy-war here because our drug market is just so profitable. It is a scary.\' Share or comment on this article: Marrickville salon shooting: Bikie brothers shot in botched assassination attempt are identified e-mail Add comment Comments 0 Share what you think No comments have so far been submitted.

Fans of the makeup mogul have now called her out for flaunting her wealth as she showed off the designer accessory which they claimed \'looked horrible with her outfit\'.

The Hulu star leaned toward the camera and revealed that she had spilled water on her bra. The mom of two shook her head and picked up a silvery grey silk dress. The Keeping Up with the Kardashians alum tied the two slim straps of the dress behind her neck and then pulled on a string on the back of the dress to fit it to her figure and create a ruching effect. She smoothed the dress over her curves and added strappy white heels to the look. As she walked towards the camera, it became obvious that she had ditched her bra as her nipples were visible beneath the fabric of her dress. Not happy: Fans of the makeup mogul have now called her out for flaunting her wealth as she showed off the designer accessory which they claimed \'looked horrible with her outfit\' She posed holding a cute white handbag which showed off her light pink manicure and the rings she wore on her fingers. The SZA song Love Galore played in the background of the TikTok. Travis Scott was featured on the original version of the song. The couple split last year for the final time.

(2081, 'Cities-have-long-made-plans-for-extreme-heat.-Are-they-enough-in-a-warming-world', 'Cities have long made plans for extreme heat. Are they enough in a warming world?', 'CHICAGO, JULY 09Natural disasters can be dramatic - barreling hurricanes, building-toppling tornadoes - but heat is more deadly. Chicago learned that the hard way in 1995. That J...', 'Natural disasters can be dramatic - barreling hurricanes, building-toppling tornadoes - but heat . Chicago learned that the hard way in 1995. That July, a weeklong heat wave that hit 106 degrees Fahrenheit (41 degrees Celsius) Most of the deaths occurred in poor and majority Black neighborhoods, where many elderly or isolated people suffered without proper ventilation or air conditioning. Power outages from an overwhelmed grid made it all worse. Initially slow to react, Chicago has since developed emergency heat response plans that include a massive push to alert the public and then connect the most vulnerable to the help they may need. Other cities like Los Angeles, Miami and Phoenix now have \"chief heat officers\" to coordinate planning and response for dangerous heat. Around the world, cities and countries have adopted similar measures. But experts warn those steps might not be enough and with continuing inequality in who is most vulnerable. \"I don\'t know a single city that is truly prepared for that some climate scientists fear,\" said Eric Klinenberg, a professor of social sciences at New York University who wrote a book about the Chicago heat wave. Heat preparedness has generally improved over the years as forecasting has become more accurate, and as meteorologists, journalists and government officials have focused on spreading the word of upcoming danger. Chicago, for example, has expanded its emergency text and email notification system and identified its most vulnerable residents for outreach. But what works in one city might not be as effective in another. That\'s because each has its own unique architecture, transportation, layout and inequities, said Bharat Venkat, an associate professor at UCLA who directs the university\'s Heat Lab, aimed at tackling what he calls \"thermal inequality.\" Venkat thinks cities should address inequality by investing in labor rights, sustainable development and more. That may sound expensive - who pays, for instance, when a city tries to improve conditions for workers in blistering food trucks? - but Venkat thinks doing nothing will ultimately cost more. \"The status quo is actually deeply expensive,\" he said. \"We just don\'t do the math.\" France launched a heat watch warning system after an extended heat wave in 2003 was estimated to have caused 15,000 deaths - many of them older people in city apartments and homes without air conditioning. The system includes public announcements urging people to hydrate. Just last month, Germany launched a new that it said was inspired by France\'s experience. In India, a powerful heat wave in 2010 with temperatures over 118 degrees Fahrenheit (48 degrees Celsius) led to the deaths of over 1,300 people in the city of Ahmedabad. City officials now have a heat action plan to improve awareness in the local population and health care staff. Another simple initiative: Painting roofs white to reflect the blazing sun. Ladd Keith, an assistant professor at the University of Arizona, cited Baltimore\'s Code Red Extreme Heat alerts as an example of a well-designed alert system. The alerts go out when the forecast calls for a heat index of 105 Fahrenheit or higher, and sets in motion things like more social services in communities most vulnerable to heat risks. He lauded the heat officers in cities like Los Angeles, Miami and Phoenix, but said there are \"still over 19,000 cities and towns without them.\" Inkyu Han, an environmental health scientist at Temple University in Philadelphia, noted that cities are still struggling to get aids such as cooling centers and subsidized air conditioning into poorer neighborhoods. He said more can be done, too, with simple and sustainable solutions such as improving tree canopy. \"Notably, low-income neighborhoods and communities of color in Philadelphia often lack street trees and green spaces,\" Han said. In Providence, Rhode Island, the Atlantic Ocean typically moderates temperatures but the region can still get heat waves. Kate Moretti, an emergency room physician, said the city\'s hospitals see more patients when the heat strikes - with increases in illnesses that may not be obviously related to heat, like heart attacks, kidney failure and mental health problems. \"We definitely notice that it puts a strain on the system,\" Moretti said. Older people, , people with disabilities and people who are homeless make up a big share of those admissions, she said. Miami - considered a ground zero for the climate change threat due to its vulnerability to sea level rise, flooding, hurricanes and extreme heat - appointed its heat officer two years ago to develop strategies to keep people safe from the heat. Robin Bachin, an associate professor of civic and community engagement at the University of Miami, noted that the federal government has laws to protect people in cold climates from having their heat shut off in dangerous conditions, but doesn\'t have something similar for cooling. \"For people in apartments that are not publicly subsidized, there is no requirement for landlords to provide air conditioning,\" Bachin said. \"That\'s incredibly dangerous to particularly our local low-income population, let alone people who are unhoused or are outdoor workers.\" Klinenberg said that the United States has so far gotten lucky with the duration of most heat waves, but that electrical grids vulnerable to high demand in some regions, along with persistent social inequities, could spell serious trouble in the coming decades. That\'s partly because the underlying social problems that make heat events so deadly are only getting worse, Klinenberg said. Chicago\'s 1995 deaths were clustered not only in poor and segregated neighborhoods, but also specifically within what he calls \"depleted\" neighborhoods, places where it\'s harder for people to gather together and where social connections have been worn thin. Empty lots, abandoned restaurants and poorly maintained parks mean that people are less likely to check up on each other. Noboru Nakamura, a professor of atmospheric sciences at the University of Chicago who specializes in extreme weather events, said he thinks Chicago has made plenty of smart changes by implementing heat emergency plans, routine wellness checks and cooling centers. But he too cited inequality as a difficult challenge. \"A systemic problem of a resource inequity is something that you can\'t really get rid of overnight. And we still have the same issue that we had back then today,\" Nakamura said. \"So that aspect still is a big, big, big, big unsolved problem.\"', 'https://thehimalayantimes.com/thehimalayantimes/uploads/images/2023/07/09/24684.jpg', NULL, 'https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/cities-have-long-made-plans-for-extreme-heat-are-they-enough-in-a-warming-world', '2023-07-09 08:52:56', 'Nepal', NULL, '2023-07-09 15:30:02', '2023-07-09 15:30:02', 9, NULL, '', 0),

Race stream and latest updates as Max Verstappen leads Lando Norris', 'British Grand Prix LIVE!', 'LIVE! The roadshow rolls back into this weekend for one of the signature staple events on the annual racing calendar. Hundreds of thousands of car fanatics have descended upon this famous corner of Northamptonshire, where there is even more glitz and glamour than usual with a distinct Hollywood flavour as Brad Pitt films scenes from his highly-anticipated upcoming film. On the track, is looking to win the British Grand Prix for the first time at an unhappy hunting ground for Red Bull as the dominant reigning world champion claimed yet another pole position in search of a sixth successive race victory this afternoon. Behind him it’s Britain’s Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri, with McLaren having produced a dream finish to qualifying on Saturday as their new upgrades take quick effect. Lewis Hamilton is an eight-time winner of his home race but faces a hugely difficult task today from seventh on the grid, one spot behind Mercedes team-mate and fellow Briton George Russell. Race organisers will be hoping to avoid any potentially dangerous environmental protests this afternoon after Just Stop Oil continued their campaign at Wimbledon. Follow all the drama from the British Grand Prix live below, with Matt Majendie reporting from Silverstone. Lap 22: The dream could be over for Norris, with Verstappen leading by five seconds. How have McLaren found this improved pace at their homw race? Some have been suggesting their upgrades are a copycat of the Red Bull. But team boss Andrea Stella said such a comparison is unfair. Saying that, their improved pace has been enough for Mercedes to readily admitted that they might change tack once more again and be more Red Bull-esque with their sidepods. Whatever the case, they’re currently off the McLaren’s race pace. Lap 14: “The wind is making it difficult to drive at the moment.” Lando Norris still trails, with Piastri just behind him. Lap 11: Red Bull team radio suggests some light rain will arrive in 2-3 minutes and last for around 3-4 minutes. Lap 10: A real shame for Ocon, who suffered front wing damage early on and has been forced to retire. Ah, we have the 2023 season familiarity after all now. Verstappen gets past Norris and you hear a slight deflation from those inside Silverstone. He’s now a second clear and, unless there’s a reliability issue or else the rain comes down (it’s possible as it’s been reported nearby), you’d think it’s win No8 on the cards for the Dutchman. Interestingly, he’s never won the British Grand Prix before although did win the second of two Silverstone races in Covid times, the so called 70th Anniversary Race. Lap 7: Hasn’t been a great start for Lewis Hamilton after drifting wide at the start but he’s up ahead of Fernando Alonso into seventh. Norris and Piastri are going to attack leader Verstappen together. Lap 5: Verstappen moves inside Norris with absolute ease to reclaim top spot. Lap 4: Ominous signs as Verstappen cuts Norris’s lead down to half a second. The mighty Red Bull is edging closer and, with DRS enabled, this could be huge. Lapo 3: With two laps down, DRS is now in play.', 'https://static.standard.co.uk/2023/07/09/15/newFile-2.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp', NULL, 'https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/formula-one/f1-british-grand-prix-2023-live-stream-race-updates-latest-news-result-today-b1093164.html', '2023-07-09 08:50:31', 'united kingdom', NULL, '2023-07-09 15:30:02', '2023-07-09 15:30:02', 2, 'F1;Sport', '', 0),

According to the new norms, each captive power user, even in a group captive structure has to hold 26% ownership in the captive generating plant. Earlier a minimum of 26% was to be collectively held by captive users. Further, if the captive power generating plant is set up by an affiliate company, the captive user would have to hold a minimum of 51% ownership in that affiliate company. According to Ramanuj Kumar, Partner at Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas, the move would allow subsidiaries of captive users to set up captive generating plants and benefit from cross subsidy surcharge (CSS) waiver, providing more flexibility to captive users. He, however, noted that more clarity is required for the norms. “It would have a considerable impact in terms of progress and expansion of the captive generation sector,\" he said. Further, as per the Electricity (Amendment) Rules, 2023, the period of the license of a distribution licensee would be 25 years. Further, at the end of the 25 years, the license would be deemed renewed unless it has been revoked during the period. Earlier, the licensees had to apply for renewal of their license after the given timeline. “The licence granted by the Appropriate Commission under section 14 of the Act and the deemed licence under first, second and fifth proviso to said section 14 shall be deemed to be renewed unless the same is revoked: Provided that such renewal, shall be for a period of twenty five years at a time or for a lesser period, if requested by the licensee,\" said the government notification. Ramanuj Kumar of Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas said that the move would attract more private players in the power distribution business. “It consequently makes it more attractive for the private sector who wants to invest in distribution business as you are assured of a runway of 50 years as opposed to a runaway of 25 years and then you needed to factor in that there could be a contingency when you license could not be renewed. This contingency has effectively been sort of removed.

Investigations by […] The post Army bosses fume as ‘unconstitutional’ spy group muscles into election role first appeared on My Zimbabwe News.', 'TENSIONS are mounting within state security structures and government, as well as Zanu PF, over the role being played by the shadowy Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO)-run Forever Associates Zimbabwe (Faz) which has unconstitutionally seized control of the running of the 2023 elections to retain President Emmerson Mnangagwa and the ruling party in power. Investigations by The NewsHawks have shown that senior army commanders, both serving and retired, are sceptical, suspicious and even resentful of the role being played by Faz which has displaced them from their decades-old feeding trough of unconstitutionally and unlawfully running elections. Faz, which is well-resourced with money and cars, is led by CIO deputy director-general Walter Tapfumaneyi. It has thousands of officers and volunteers working through intelligence structures to door-to-door campaigns, night vigils, community events, technology-based messaging and monitoring all stages of the electoral process. Insiders say Mnangagwa — who operates more like a securocrat than a civilian politician — has deployed Faz to ensure his re-election. However, some army commanders are against the idea. A military source said: “The problem is a clash between politics and strategy. Things were just changed suddenly, without consultations, hence no proper planning. The move to sideline the army from the electoral process, replacing them with Faz, has caused deep divisions and tensions.” One military commander said Faz could become a Frankenstein monster — a thing which destroys its creator — for Mnangagwa. “As the army, we don’t know anything about Faz, except what we read in the media. Who are these people? What is their agenda and what will happen after the elections? We were not consulted when this structure was set up and put under CIO. Can they be able to campaign and win elections for Mnangagwa and Zanu PF? Do they have the capacity to do that? Since they are not a constitutional structure, what is the legality of what they are doing?” Military chiefs are also complaining in the background that Faz is an unconstitutional entity and its activities involving the use of public funds are thus illegal. Faz has been arbitrarily deployed to coordinate Zanu PF electoral activities on the ground, while at the same time checkmating the army that used to spearhead campaigns. This has created a strategic brinkmanship between the army and CIO on the ground. Faz — which has millions of dollars and hundreds of cars for campaigns — was revived and deployed last year to unconstitutionally run or influence the elections and their outcome. It was formed in 2010. Elections in Zimbabwe are run by securocrats to rescue Zanu PF and its leaders. Past elections were coordinated through the Joint Operations Command (Joc), which brings together the army, intelligence and police. The military has been playing a key role in elections most prominently after 2000 when the opposition became strong. Enter Faz Fearing defeat largely due to internal sabotage, Mnangagwa brought in Faz and pushed the army to play a peripheral and marginal role by providing liaison officers through Heritage Trust, its front organisation. Just like the military which has Heritage, Fairhaven which owns Africom or Rusununguko/Nkululeko Holdings, the CIO also acts through various front organisations such as Faz and Chiltern Trust. Faz is coordinating Zanu PF structures, from cell, branches, districts, district coordinating committees, provinces, the national consultative assembly, central committee to politburo, as well as MPs at ward and constituency levels to ensure they run a tight ship. Faz is supervising Zanu PF programmes throughout the constituencies, while motivating and directing lower party structures to participate in the electoral process, recently in voters’ roll inspection. As reported by The NewsHawks last week, Faz has penetrated communities up to grassroots level and tightened its grip on the electoral process. While Zanu PF has over many years leveraged the military and other state security agents — through Joc — which brings together the command element of security structures, there is concern that Faz is neither a proper security structure nor a constitutional creature. “Faz is drawing resources illegally and using the logistics and infrastructure of the CIO to carry out its unconstitutional mandate, although it is run by a tiny section of the CIO. Unlike in the past, there is concern that Faz has been brazen in its operations, invading polling stations and collecting people’s identity documents whereas in the past interventions were more covert,” said a government official. “The concern is that Faz is a personal army or militia belonging to the President and run by CIO deputy director-general Walter Tapfumaneyi. The group excludes some senior CIO staffers and other security agents.” Sidelined army commanders aligned to Vice-President Constantino Chiwenga, who ran the last elections and previous ones under the late former president Robert Mugabe, are sulking and furious about this strategy. Faz has spread its tentacles to every ward in the country, collecting vital voters’ details right down to household level using an army of 5 910 information gatherers. The information gatherers — three in each of the country’s 1 970 wards — are working under the close supervision of their CIO handlers. The scientific-like CIO strategy enables Zanu PF to control the electoral process in terms of structures, numbers of registered voters and the actual voting process, as well as polling stations. It also promotes systematic voter intimidation and victimisation, especially at ward level. An operational Faz document titled Faz Campaign Scope seen by The NewsHawks says the organisation has penetrated all provinces up to household level through several tactics, leaving voters vulnerable to abuse during the 23 August elections. “Once the party has access to the voters’ roll, preferably broken down to constituencies and even to polling stations, volunteers must keep in touch with registered voters through texting and phoning. This must be done almost intrusively, as a way of maintaining intimacy. Volunteers should be in the habit of checking on the health and well-being of voters as a way of showing the party’s and candidate’s concern. This can also be used for reminding voters of important election-related events and issues, while also keeping them up to date on key developments,” the document reads. “Faz volunteers are required to intrusively access party cell registers, from party cell chairmen, and check and verify their accuracy and integrity. To this end, Faz then discretely conducts a head count of cell members, checking if they are registered to vote. If any party members or holders of positions of leadership are found not to have national documents or registered to vote, Faz, therefore, will handhold and assist all those to rectify the discrepancy under supervision. “Volunteers must be available to furnish voters with the party’s and candidate’s campaign literature in their homes and workspaces. This will be done door-to-door or at community gatherings. Literature will also be distributed at markets, bus termini or shops, thus helping to expand the campaign to voters outside the volunteer’s immediate area of responsibility.” Volunteers were also tasked with administering voter education, assisting undocumented people or aliens to acquire national registration documents and to register to vote. “These interventions, which are already taking place in all constituencies nationwide, should result in a significant surge in registered voters who attribute that achievement to President ED (Mnangagwa) and Zanu PF. Volunteers must maintain contact with people they would have assisted to register to vote or to acquire national documents so that they are not won over to the opposition’s poisonous narratives,” the document reads. Critical information being collected by the agents and informers includes names, addresses, identity numbers and voter registration details at polling station level. Faz is also counting people at household level before recording the information on their tablets and smartphones. The information, which will be computed, condensed into data and processed, I will be crucial in influencing and manipulating the electoral process in favour of Zanu PF through a combination of tactics, including persuasion and intimidation, in some cases. It is also being used to predict potential outcomes, using real figures, so that Zanu PF knows which constituencies and wards to put campaign resources in or activate its coercive machinery. The NewsHawks has previously gathered and reported that Faz has received US$10 million and 200 cars to run its affairs in preparation for elections. Additional resources have been promised to capacitate the secret structure. Faz’s mandate, working together with the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission and its chair Justice Priscilla Chigumba, is to coordinate logistics and decisive forces to retain Mnangagwa in power. The NewsHawks investigation also established that Faz has structures at national, provincial, district, constituency and ward levels – where minute details are collected for use in the electoral process. The organisation is visible countrywide and has been sending shivers down the spines of many, especially opposition supporters, particularly in rural areas. With its members spread across provinces, Faz rose to prominence last year by playing a pivotal role in making Zanu PF cell registers before running Zanu PF primary elections this year. The organisation also mobilised people during voter registration and they caused panic due to their presence at Zimbabwe Electoral Zec centres during the recently held voters’ roll inspection exercise. How Faz operates Information gathered through interviews and reading an operational document shows provincial coordinators report to Tapfumaneyi. The provincial coordinators have teams in each district countrywide, led by district intelligence officers. The CIO structure includes directors and branches they run at the top at its Chaminuka Building headquarters and its sub-offices in Harare, provincial intelligence officers and district intelligence officers. There also several other departments involved. District intelligence officers and coordinators oversee operations in constituencies. At ward level, Faz has recruited and trained three Zanu PF-aligned members to collect information under the supervision of CIO operatives. A Faz operational document calls the three civilians in each ward “volunteers”. Zimbabwe has 1 970 wards, meaning Faz has recruited 5 910 volunteers who are part of its machinery to run the elections. In Masvingo province, which has 240 wards, there are 720 Faz volunteers in total. The volunteers report to CIO operatives who manage intelligence at constituency level and their information is transmitted through applications on their phones provided by Faz. They also collect Global Positioning System (GPS) coordinates for each household and monitor political activities of people in their respective areas. The approach and systematic use of data for political and electoral purposes amounts to an illegal mass surveillance and data collection technique, an intricate “watch over” of people, in this specific case in Masvingo using technology and other means. CIO operatives and Faz volunteers attend most Zanu PF events and their presence is usually acknowledged by ruling party officials. Faz has a specific mandate to undermine the opposition. “The message must seek to thoroughly discredit the opposition and its candidate, rendering them unelectable. This includes anything that makes their candidate stink to the heavens, and speaking against their party’s anarchic, subversive, treasonous, undemocratic and terrorist pedigree and related actions,” the document reads. The document also carries the code of conduct for all Faz members which urges members to be ambassadors of Zanu PF who should only represent the interests of the party. “We do not and shall not claim to have any other identity than that we are members of Faz Trust, a private organisation, which is an affiliate of Zanu PF. We are as individuals, proudly members of Zanu PF and are unapologetic about this reality,” reads part of the code of conduct. Faz members say they can easily identify non-Zanu PF members because they have access to Zanu PF cell registers. “The assumption is that one is either an opposition supporter or an undecided voter, if they are registered to vote but do not appear in Zanu PF structures. So, there is a deliberate effort to recruit from this pool and that’s where persuasion and propaganda come in,” said a Faz member. “Of course, some are known opposition activists or sympathisers. Intimidation is then deployed on such people. In rural areas, the message has been clear to such people that they are viewed with suspicion because they are not in party structures.” — NewsHawks', NULL, NULL, 'https://www.myzimbabwe.co.zw/news/111561-army-bosses-fume-as-unconstitutional-spy-group-muscles-into-election-role.html', '2023-07-09 09:15:29', 'Zimbabwe', NULL, '2023-07-09 16:00:02', '2023-07-09 16:00:02', 2, 'News', '', 0);

They can become ideal stopovers for cargo vessels passing in the international sea lane below Sri Lanka for replenishment of fuel, stores and provisions Estimates peg the global bunker fuel market at $164.9 billion by 2030, with a CAGR of 4.3 per cent, from $109.6 billion in 2020. The market has recovered after a lull during Covid, with a rising demand for bunker fuel. Major ports such as Cochin, Chennai and New Mangalore Port are strongly involved in the bunkering business, especially with the post-Covid surge in demand. Cochin, in particular, is an ideal location, thanks to its proximity to the major international shipping route and the presence of all major oil companies. Vikas Narwal, Deputy Chairperson, Cochin Port, said the port is geared up to provide quality service to the shipping and logistics trade passing along the peninsular rim of India. This would bolster the competitive position of Cochin and, in turn, help realise the true potential of the country’s blue economy. The bunkering volume during 2022-23 touched 3,65,983 tonnes. Of this, the share of coastal shipping was 1,26,247 tonnes and foreign ships was 2,39,736 tonnes. The strategic position of the port also offers potential for bunkering mid-voyage, whereby a ship carries minimum bunkers at the load port so that it can load more cargo and later, after burning fuel during passage, refills during the loaded passage. This enables the vessel to carry more cargo and earn more freight. To tap the bunkering potential on the East Coast, Chennai port constructed a 180 m and 9 m draft bunker berth at a cost of ₹50 crore (₹22 crore from the Centre). With more than 4,000 vessel calls per annum in Chennai region alone, the south-eastern coast of India — which primarily caters to the four States of Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka — has huge potential for bunker fuel supply. Vimal Bhargavan, Senior Deputy Traffic Manager, Chennai Port, said the management is in discussion with bunker suppliers, including IndianOil. The port has space for creation of infrastructure like tank farms in close proximity to the bunker berth. New Mangalore Port supplied 56,252 tonnes in FY23. The figure in the first quarter of the current fiscal stood at 18,107 tonnes. With increased cargo handling at the port every year, the business is expected to grow further. However, industry sources voiced concern over the five per cent GST levied on bunker fuel, making the business unattractive. In competing ports such as Singapore, Colombo, and Fujairah there is no such tax. “Just as fuelling of foreign airlines in Indian airports is considered as export, the same status should apply for fuelling of foreign ships in Indian ports,” a senior official in a PSU oil marketing company said. Earlier, bunker fuel supplied to foreign flag vessels used to be under the ‘deemed export’ category in the VAT regime. Now it is under the category of domestic sale, as per GST law. If supply of bunker fuel to foreign vessels is made within 200 nautical miles of the port limit, it should be considered as a supply made in Indian waters and subject to GST, the official said, adding that every supplier is liable to be registered under the provisions of GST law. To maintain competitive rates and attract more shipping companies to India, it is crucial to exempt bunker fuels from tax. Tax exemption can provide a level playing field for Indian ports to compete with major bunkering hubs. Though the Government has reduced the GST on bunkers to five per cent, this may not be enough, as bunkers in competing ports in the region are fully tax free.

Compared with 2008 levels, the United Nations\' global shipping regulator agreed to cut total annual emissions of greenhouse gases \"by at least 20%, striving for 30%, by 2030\" and \"by at least 70%, striving for 80%, by 2040\" according to the agreement. That compared with the prior target for a 50% reduction by mid-century from 2008. The International Maritime Organisation (IMO) described the deal as \"historic\", adding that it \"remains committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions from international shipping and, as a matter of urgency, aims to phase them out as soon as possible\". The IMO said the \"carbon intensity\" of ships was expected to decline over time with \"further improvement of energy efficiency\" of new vessels. Shipping emits roughly the same level of greenhouse gases as aviation, which is aiming for net zero by 2050. The deal came at the end of a five-day meeting at the IMO\'s headquarters in London, attended by representatives from 100 countries. The gathering of its Marine Environment Protection Commission pitted climate-vulnerable nations - particularly islands in the Pacific -- and richer countries against big exporters like China. The vast majority of the world\'s 100,000 cargo ships - which carry 90% of the world\'s goods - are powered by highly-polluting diesel. Shipping is responsible for around three percent of global greenhouse gas emissions according to the UN. Non-governmental organisations with a focus on climate slammed the agreement, arguing it was insufficient under the framework of the landmark Paris climate accord. The NGOs instead want the shipping sector to implement a 50% reduction by 2030 and deliver carbon neutrality by 2040. \"There is no excuse for this wish and a prayer agreement,\" said John Maggs, president of the Clean Shipping Coalition. \"They knew what the science required, and that a 50% cut in emissions by 2030 was both possible and affordable. \"Instead the level of ambition agreed is far short of what is needed to be sure of keeping global heating below 1.5 Celsius, and the language seemingly contrived to be vague and non-committal,\" he said. Under the 2015 Paris agreement, nations have pledged to reach net-zero carbon emissions by the middle of the century with the aim of limiting the increase in global temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Argentina, Brazil and China, in particular, had strongly resisted tougher IMO targets, arguing they cost poor, developing countries the most. They are also strongly opposed to a flagship proposal for a global levy, or carbon tax, on shipping emissions. French President Emmanuel Macron backed the idea at a recent climate finance summit in Paris, but said it would need backing from China, the United States and other European nations to work.

Kathleen Drew-Baker made groundbreaking discoveries about the reproduction of \"nori\" seaweed - the crispy dried sheets that encircle sushi rolls - helping kick-start its farming on a commercial scale. Her studies at the University of Manchester allowed Japan to ramp up production in the difficult period after World War II, when small-scale growers were having trouble meeting demand. But she carried out her most influential work as an unpaid research fellow, having lost her academic post after marriage because of the university\'s policy at the time against employing married women. Although Drew-Baker died in 1957, her memory lives on in the city of Uto in Kumamoto, one of Japan\'s largest nori-growing regions. Dozens of people from local fisheries, as well as scientists and history buffs, gather each April in the leafy grounds of a shrine by the ocean, where a stone plinth displays an embossed metal plaque of her face. Large Japanese and British flags are raised at the event, where a Shinto priest \"gives thanks\" to Drew-Baker, organiser Fumiichi Yamamoto, 86, told AFP. \"Seaweed producers were happy and grateful\" for the ability to grow more nori seaweed in the aftermath of the war, \"when people were struggling with food shortages,\" he said. The crop has been harvested from Japan\'s coastline for centuries, and farmed for 500 years. Apart from its use in sushi, it is also a key ingredient in \"onigiri\" rice balls, a staple snack food in Japan, and is used to garnish bowls of ramen and other classic dishes. But the seaweed is notoriously fragile, and easily wiped out by typhoons and pollution. In 1949, Drew-Baker published a landmark study in the scientific journal Nature about laver, another name for nori. The crop grows off the coast of Wales, and is used to produce a traditional dish called laverbread. \"Up until that point, the life cycle of nori wasn\'t well known,\" Yamamoto said. The research gave new insights into how the plant bores into seashells where it produces new spores. Drew-Baker made contact with a professor at Kyushu University, and \"sent over an academic paper to him with a question: isn\'t Japanese seaweed like this too?\" he said. Japanese scientists and nori farmers then began experimenting with using oyster shells to help the marine plant thrive. \"It was a success,\" said Yamamoto, the son of a seaweed wholesaler, who has run the memorial event for 50 years. Now, \"nori is one of the essential foods of Japan\".', 'https://scripts.24.co.za/img/sites/fin24.png', NULL, 'https://www.news24.com/fin24/Climate_Future/News/the-uk-botanist-who-helped-revive-japans-seaweed-industry-20230706-2', '2023-07-09 10:08:51', 'south africa', NULL, '2023-07-09 16:30:01', '2023-07-09 16:30:01', 1, NULL, '', 0),

The omens were good for England as they looked to resurrect their Ashes campaign, given that the last five international Test matches at Headingley had all be won by the team fielding first, with three of those spectacular fourth-innings run chases. Needing 224 more runs at the start of day four therefore seemed like a more than gettable total to secure the win to stop Australia retaining the Ashes with two matches to spare. However, after Joe Root departed before lunch, followed by captain Ben Stokes early in the afternoon session, the writing appeared to be on the wall, but Brook\'s brave innings got England within touching distance. Wood\'s 16 from eight balls and the steadying head of Chris Woakes saw the hosts home, sparking dramatic scenes of celebration in Leeds after a match where the pendulum swung hour by hour. Each Test in this series has been gripping in its own right, with day four at Headingley no different. England are still up against it in their attempts to win the Ashes, with no side coming back to win the series after being 2-0 down since 1936-37. That they are back in with a shout is mission accomplished, for now. Supporters headed to Headingley on day four hoping for more heroics from captain Stokes on the ground where his incredible 135 not out earned England a dramatic victory over their old foes in 2019. Resuming the day on 27-0 overnight, Ben Duckett fell early after looking in good touch, with returning all-rounder Moeen Ali quickly following him back to the pavilion. But even at that point, with Stokes at the crease, on the back of a battling 80 in the first innings and another century in the last Test at Lord\'s, they still seemed in a strong position. Root, ranked fifth in the world Test batting rankings, then fell to a poor shot just before lunch to shift the momentum once more. Stokes\'s dismissal early in the afternoon session gave even more impetus to Australia, with Jonny Bairstow next to go to put the tourists on the brink of the series win. Brook carried the England resistance, reaching his half-century off 57 balls — his ninth score of fifty or more for England in just 10 Tests. Scoring at a rapid rate has been Brook\'s calling card since he came into the England side. He passed 1,000 Test runs in 1,058 balls during his innings — faster than any other batter in Test history. He could not steer his team through to the end, looping a catch into the hands of Cummins, but Woakes stayed calm with a crucial 32, with a big six from Wood getting England closer to the total. It was Woakes who hit the winning runs, ensuring it is all to play for in the fourth Test in Manchester in two weeks\' time, in one of the most dramatic Ashes series in living memory.

And Aoife Harvey is making her mark on the industry - as the 23-year-old from Derry takes her sustainable designs to the screen in a BBC show. Aoife will appear on the second series of ‘A Stitch Through Time’, which returns on July 17. The designer told BelfastLive how her passion for sustainable design first started, and how it has since grown into something she is determined to make a career out of. The designer says it all started while she was studying Art and Design at the NWRC in Limavady, and completed a UAL Foundation Diploma there. “In that foundation year, sustainability was getting big, and as a young designer you don’t have a lot of money [when] you’re trying to find ways to make clothes,” she said. Read more: Important dates as Taylor Swift makes changes to Irish leg of the Eras Tour “So, I started thinking about how you can take something people see as unusable and breathe new life into it. I take materials and deconstruct them so much that you don’t even realise it was a curtain or a parachute before.” However, Aoife said her passion for fashion might have started long before then, judging by a recently-unearthed interview she gave after winning a competition when she was younger. “I said then, when I was aged eight, that when I grew up I wanted to be a fashion designer, which is so funny, because I thought this was something I decided on in further education,” she said. Aoife’s success at a young age was an early sign of what was to come, as her designs soon got recognition after she started her degree. In 2021, she placed in the top three of the Longines Irish Champions Weekend Young Designer Award, and last April she took part in the filming of the second series of ‘A Stitch Through Time’, which will be shown on BBC Northern Ireland. In the show, four up-and-coming designers compete in different challenges. Aoife will appear alongside designers AJ Tinsley, Annie Leone, and Giovanna De Bona, although the Derry woman will be the youngest featuring in the show. “It was amazing to meet the other designers, and all of them brought different skillsets and things I’ve never seen before,” said Aoife. “I’ve always enjoyed constructive criticism, and it’s fuelled what I do, so being in a competitive setting and being judged was something I really enjoyed. I think it only makes you better.” It’s clear the show was a great learning opportunity for the young designer, but it’s not the only time she will be showcasing her work to an audience this month. On July 14, Aoife will take her designs to the runway at Northern Fashion Week in Manchester, representing NI on a UK stage through her brand AH Designs. Aoife was a fashionista from a young age She said: “I’ll be the only designer from Northern Ireland over there, and to be able to represent the North is class. There is so much talent here, and there is a big textile history here, especially for myself being from Derry [where] the Derry shirt factory [was]. “Over the last few years, everyone seems to have to go away to Dublin or England for fashion work, so to show the talent here and what we have to offer is amazing.” It will be an exciting few weeks for Aoife, whose passion for sustainable fashion has now put her in the spotlight at a young age. The designer emphasises that her achievements stem from years of hard work, saying: “You don’t just get these opportunities for nothing. You have to go looking for them. Aoife working on one of her pieces “I definitely felt lost [after leaving university], because there aren’t massive opportunities in fashion here or jobs to go into. You kind of think, all these people are going to come to you with work, but it doesn’t happen like that, or at least it didn’t for me anyway.” Nothing was going to stop Aoife from following her dream, though, and as she starts to get recognition on a national level, there is no doubt this is just the beginning for the sustainable designer. What started as a far-flung wish when she was just eight years old has turned into so much more for Aoife - and she isn’t about to stop now. As she put it: “I absolutely love this, and it wouldn’t fulfil me to do anything else. It is a slow process, but I have done some incredible things, and there are so many more good things to come.” For all the latest news, visit the Belfast Live homepage here and sign up to our What\'s On newsletter here.

I thought it was abandoned.\' South Fulton police responded to the property for reports of a trespasser with the homeowner explaining he had received a notification on his phone around 6:52 a.m. that someone was at the lake house. The homeowner was inside his home at the time he got the alert and said he watched the person walk up the driveway of his home toward his lake house, according to the report. He then got into his truck to call police and said that he could see someone in his lake house, but could not see what they were doing. While still on the phone with the police dispatcher, the homeowner cautiously approached the house and as the trespasser - later identified as Kamau - came outside, he confronted him with a gun and ordered him to \'stay put.\' According to Kamau\'s account, he said he was just checking out the property when he was confronted by the homeowner who yelled: \'No motherf***ker, you stay right there\' The homeowner was inside his home at the time he got the alert and said he watched the person walk up the driveway of his home toward his lake house, according to the report Kamau reportedly yelled at the homeowner who was armed with a gun: \'Do you know who the f**k I am?

I\'m the Mayor, and I\'ll wait for my police to get here and see what happens then.\' According to Kamau\'s account in the report, he said he was just checking out the property when he was confronted by the homeowner who yelled: \'No motherf***ker, you stay right there.\' Kamau stated that he tried to introduce himself to the homeowner, but said he told him, \'If you take another step, I\'m going to shoot you,\' to which Kamau responded, \'Are you going to shoot me while I\'m walking away?\' Once police arrived, the trespasser was identified to be Kamau and the homeowner reportedly apologized to the mayor. Kamau was arrested on criminal trespassing and burglary charges, but was released later that evening after posting bond. \'I do want to thank the South Fulton police and the staff of officers for their courteous and professional service throughout the day,\' Kamau told reporters as he left the jail. He said that he apologizes \'for the negative attention that this is brought to our city.\' \'I hope that the spotlight on our city right now will highlight some of the inequities that have been happening,\' he told Fox 5 Atlanta. Kamau said that he apologizes \'for the negative attention that this is brought to our city\' Kamau is described on the city\'s website as a \'community activist and Southern, Black, Christian Socialist,\' and the first Black Lives Matter organizer elected to public office The incident is under investigation the City of South Fulton said in a statement. \'The City of South Fulton is committed to upholding the law and ensuring that all individuals, regardless of their position, are subject to the same fair and just treatment. As the investigation is still ongoing, we are unable to provide further details at this time.\' Kamau is described on the city\'s website as a \'community activist and Southern, Black, Christian Socialist,\' and the first Black Lives Matter organizer elected to public office. He was elected to the city council in 2017, sworn in as mayor in January 2022, and butted head with city officials almost immediately. Earlier this year, five out of seven city council filed a lawsuit seeking to remove Kamau from office, saying he violated a city charter. And in April, the police shut down a community Easter egg hunt because the mayor\'s office didn\'t obtain a permit for the event. Kamau said at the time that he believed it was a move of retaliation by city leaders and the chief of police.

(Lorenzo Tugnoli for The Washington Post) Comment on this story Comment JENIN REFUGEE CAMP, West Bank — Hussein Shibly walked home after Friday prayers through a city struggling to return from devastation to mere poverty. A bulldozer lifted a crushed car; men patched bullet holes in a rooftop water tank; a fire engine washed soot from a crowded street. Reaching his family’s home, Shibly climbed the stairs to a living room, reduced to a charred cave by a shoulder-fired missile. “Is this fit to live in?” he asked, standing among the blackened skeletons of couches and chairs. “Why did this happen to us?” Shibly and his neighbors are reeling from Israel’s largest military operation in the occupied West Bank in decades, a two-day incursion that unleashed firefights and air attacks on these steep streets densely packed with houses. Israeli forces launch major operation in West Bank city, killing at least 8 Israel said the assault on the Jenin refugee camp, long known as a bastion of armed Palestinian militancy, was a security imperative — to erode the strength of an expanding terrorist base. At least 50 attacks inside Israel this year originated here, officials said. The 12 Palestinians killed in the operation were all known militants, according to the Israel Defense Forces. But for families trapped in the camp by fighting, it was 44 hours of terror. Thousands of residents did manage to flee. Others hunkered down in bedrooms and bathrooms. Few suffered the range of horrors endured by the Shiblys. Hussein, 69, was up late watching television Sunday, his usual routine after years spent working the night shift at an Israeli meat processing plant. He was born in this camp, where at least 14,000 people, possibly many more, are packed into an area measuring less than half a square kilometer. Poverty and unemployment are rampant. Raids by Israeli commandos are common. That night, rumors of a big operation were swirling. But no one knew what was coming. Around 1 a.m. Monday, Hussein saw a report on Israeli news: IDF soldiers had entered the camp. Then he heard drones, many of them. “They are going to bomb,” he thought. Then came an explosion. The Shibly family lives in nine apartments in three connected houses owned by Hussein and his two brothers. They are accustomed to Israeli raids. Within minutes, dozens of members of the extended family had rushed to the basement. Almost 50 people were crowded in the low dark spaces that Hussein’s nephew Fadi uses to breed parakeets. Scores of birds fluttered and screeched as gun battles raged outside. All through the night and all day Monday, the family listened and waited, lighting candles after the power went out a few hours into the fight. “The children were terrified,” Hussein said. But Fadi, 34, worried about his pregnant wife and 3-year-old son in the crowded basement, stayed in his second-floor apartment. With his family huddled low in a living room, Fadi kept watch through a small bathroom window. The Shibly compound, high on a steep street, commands a wide view of the camp. He could see Israeli troops moving below. Neighbors called neighbors with updates. New weapons, tactics further entangle U.S. in Israeli-Palestinian conflict “Now they are going into Jaffar’s,” Fadi recalled. “Now they are raiding your cousin’s house.” Around 11 p.m. Monday, he got this call: “Fadi, they are coming to you.” He heard a racket downstairs, and, suddenly, the two doors of his apartment crashed in simultaneously, shattering the frames. About 12 soldiers poured in, all clad in body armor and wearing headlamps. Fadi, with his son crying in his arms and his wife clutching his side, stood before them and pleaded in Hebrew: “Easy! Easy! A little one here!” he remembers saying. “Your ID,” the leader commanded in Arabic. “Where are the terrorists?” The soldiers blew out the candles, cuffed Fadi with plastic ties and ordered the three into the living room. Through the open door, they watched the troops search through cupboards. One set up at the wide kitchen window. Soon, he began firing in long bursts with his automatic rifle. Bullet casings fell by the hundreds onto the tile floor. “Please!” Fadi shouted. “The boy is terrified.” Below, the other family members were in despair. Fadi had stopped responding. “We thought he was dead,” Hussein said. “The women were screaming and crying.” The firing continued. Fadi’s wife asked to get a toy for the child, and a commander led Fadi to a bedroom filled with plastic trucks and scooters. When the soldier saw a toy machine gun by the door, he swore, Fadi said, hit him on the shoulder with his rifle butt and pushed him back to the living room. They asked to join their family in the basement. The commander said no, Fadi recounted. They all would be leaving soon, he told them. About midnight, calls came from a loudspeaker: “Get out! Get out! You will be safe.” The people in the basement scrambled to gather documents and diapers and rushed to the courtyard, where they found a firetruck, a Red Crescent team and Fadi’s family. They surrounded them, hugging and crying, as a medic cut Fadi’s cuffs off. “Walk out together,” a firefighter advised them. “Men should stay in a group with the women and children so they will not get shot.” They picked their way down the lanes, over rubble and downed cables. One long street was plowed like a farm furrow where Israeli bulldozers had intentionally detonated explosives embedded in the pavement. Once outside the camp, the family spread out to the homes of relatives. Hussein was glued to the television. Late Tuesday, he saw reports that a shoulder-fired missile had struck near the Abdullah Azzam mosque in his neighborhood. “I saw that it wasn’t the mosque that was harmed; it was our house,” he said. “I watched on TV, fire eating up my son’s house.” It was still smoldering when he returned Wednesday morning, a few hours after Israeli forces pulled out of the Jenin camp. Fadi’s apartment was littered with bullet casings. Hussein said that there had been no reason to target their compound — that no one in the family was involved with militant groups, and that none were wanted by the Israelis. “We all have permits to work in Israel. They know us well,” said Hussein, recalling his years working side by side with Israeli Jews on a kosher-compliance team, led by a rabbi, that monitored animal health conditions. The Israeli military did not respond to a request for comment on why the Shibly house might have been targeted. On Friday, as a surveillance drone hovered overhead, life was returning to the compound. Women cooked in Hussein’s ground-floor apartment. Fadi tended to his birds. About 20 of them had died of lack of food during the incursion, he said. The United Nations has called for donors to help rebuild Jenin. The United Arab Emirates pledged $15 million on Thursday. But Hussein is skeptical. “We hear about money on the news, but we never see any of it,” he said. He has little faith that things will change. Jenin will remain poor, and Israeli forces will return. “They will be back,” Hussein said. “They said they wanted to eliminate resistance in Jenin. But they will not.” Gift this article Gift Article Publisher', NULL, NULL, 'https://insidexpress.com/news/israels-military-operation-in-the-jenin-refugee-camp-an-insightful-familys-perspective/', '2023-07-09 10:37:39', 'united kingdom', NULL, '2023-07-09 17:00:02', '2023-07-09 17:00:02', 2, 'News;camp;Familys;Insightful;Israels;Jenin;military;Operation;Perspective;refugee', '', 0);

The Labour leader’s furious remark followed an animated presentation from climate and net zero spokesperson Ed Miliband setting out his revolutionary energy policies . Mr Miliband is said to have told his colleagues of the hope and change his policies would bring, receiving only a lukewarm reception from Sir Keir. Sir Keir “thanked him for his presentation but said he wasn’t interested in hope and change ”, according to a source. The source told The Sunday Times : “He was more interested in creating sustainable new jobs to replace jobs in old sectors that were being lost. He then said he was not interested in tree huggers, before adding to everyone’s surprise, ‘In fact, I hate tree huggers’.” His comments, at a meeting the day after Sir Keir gave a major speech on Labour’s energy policy, surprised some in the room. The Labour leader and shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves have faced a backlash from the left of the party over a decision to scale back plans for a £28bn “green prosperity plan” . But Ms Reeves insisted on Sunday that she “cares passionately about tackling the climate emergency”. And while she said she “loves a tree”, she lashed out at “rude” environmental protesters such as Just Stop Oil who cause “needless disruption to people’s lives”. Ms Reeves said there are “better ways to tackle the climate emergency than stopping working people getting to their jobs”. Luke Tryl, UK director at the More in Common group, said Labour risked “throwing the baby out with the bath water” over climate issues. He said it “makes total sense” to condemn Just Stop Oil and Sadiq Khan’s expansion of London’s Ulez scheme. “But if Labour strategists think climate isn’t a mainstream electoral issue, their assumptions about voters are a decade out of date,” Mr Tryl added.

Ukraine, as it continues to defend against Russian aggression, is expecting an invitation to join NATO – but Biden and other allies aren\'t so sure about the prospects. President Biden claims that Russian President Vladimir Putin \'s objective in invading Ukraine in February 2022 was to break up NATO once and for all – and insisted the main goal should be stopping that effort. \'I don\'t think [Ukraine is] ready for membership in NATO,\' Biden said during a foreign policy-centric interview with CNN \'s Fareed Zakaria GPS aired on Sunday morning. Biden departed the U.S. on Sunday morning for the 2023 NATO Summit in Lithuania after spending the weekend at his beach house in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware. He said that there is a divide within NATO over members\' uncertainty in bringing Ukraine into the fold in the middle of its war with Russia. President Joe Biden departed Sunday morning for the 2023 NATO Summit in Lithuania after claiming Ukraine is \'not ready\' for entry into the treaty organization Speaking with CNN\'s Fareed Zakaria, Biden said Ukraine needs to end its war with Russia before admittance into NATO \'I spent, as you know, a great deal of time trying to hold NATO together because I believe [Russian President Vladimir] Putin has had an overwhelming objective from the time he launched 185,000 troops into Ukraine, and that was to break NATO,\' Biden explained. \'He was confident he could break NATO. So, holding NATO together is really critical.\' \'I don\'t think there is unanimity in NATO about whether or not to bring Ukraine into the NATO family now, at this moment, in the middle of a war.\' Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is urging NATO to send a \'clear signal\' during this week\'s summit on whether the country will be admitted. Delaware Democratic Sen. Chris Coons also said Sunday morning to CBS host Margaret Brennan that NATO cannot admit Ukraine at the moment. He said that the war with Russia must first \'be resolved\' with Ukraine the victor before NATO can consider adding them to the treaty. \'They are on track to join the EU...which lays the foundation for NATO membership in the future,\' Coons said during his interview on CBS Face the Nation. In Biden\'s rare sit-down interview with CNN, the president managed to steer clear of answering any difficult questions involving his son Hunter or the discovery of cocaine in the White House. Host Zakaria kept the focus on foreign policy – but never once asked Biden about his son, despite a growing public sentiment that the president was \'likely involved\' in Hunter\'s foreign business deals. The interview was taped Friday, July 7 at the White House as Biden prepares to attend the 2023 NATO Summit this week in Vilnius, Lithuania. It was also the first time Biden engaged in an interview since the U.S. Secret Service found last Sunday a white powder substance in the White House that turned out to be cocaine . Trolls online immediately jumped to blaming Hunter for bringing the illicit drug into the White House. Biden said Russian President Vladimir Putin\'s goal in invading Ukraine last February was to break up NATO – and said the main goal is to avoid that happening Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky wants and expects to be admitted to NATO and wants the summit to produce a \'clear signal\' on where the request lies Joe Biden\'s rare sit-down interview with CNN\'s Fareed Zakaria did not include any questions on the president\'s son Hunter Biden or the discovery of cocaine in the White House last week Biden, wearing slip-on sneakers, entered Air Force One from the under-belly stairs instead of taking the much longer and grander ladder truck. Critics have noticed that the president has stopped taking the longer stair-case after a series of fumbles and trips adding to questions over his fitness for office Despite swirling questions over the incident last week, Biden was not asked any questions related to the discovery of cocaine and the ongoing investigation into the matter. He has also ignored questions on the subject from members of the press during public appearances. There were also no questions regarding the president\'s 52-year-old son, who remains under multiple investigations related to his years of foreign business and allegations of using his father\'s position for his family\'s financial gain and enrichment. Meanwhile, a new Rasmussen poll released on Sunday shows that 58 percent of Americans think that President Biden was at least \'very or somewhat likely\' involved in his son Hunter\'s foreign business deals. The survey conducted June 28-29 and July 2 shows only 14 percent think it was \'not very likely\' and 19 percent say it was \'not at all likely\' that Biden was involved. Biden was also not forced to face questions on the recent plea deal his son reached with the Justice Department that will allow him to avoid jail time. Hunter Biden is pleading guilty to two tax-related charges, as well as reached a probation deal for a separate charge for lying on a federal form to purchase a firearm. He checked a box indicating he was not using or addicted to any illegal drugs at the time of the gun purchase, while timelines detailed in his own book are to the contrary. Public outcry ensued over news of the deal with claims of preferential treatment due to who the defendant\'s father is. The interview aired the same day a new Rasmussen poll revealed that 58% of likely voters think that President Biden was involved in Hunter\'s foreign business dealings Cocaine was discovered at the White House last week, overshadowing the usual July 4 celebrations. Trolls online immediately said Biden\'s addict son Hunter was to blame for bringing the illegal drug onto the property Zakaria kept all questions mainly focused on foreign policy, besides one age-related question at the tail-end of the interview. The president was not faced with any difficult questions related to his son Hunter During the interview for CNN\'s Fareed Zakaria GPS program airing on Sunday morning, the president discussed sending munitions aid to Ukraine in its war with Russia, his talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russia\'s President Vladimir Putin and the upcoming NATO Summit. Zakaria kept all the questions foreign policy-related until the very tail-end of the interview where he talked about how age has become a central issue to the 2024 presidential race. Instead of making the case for why he is fit for office or further dismissing concerns over his age or physical and mental abilities, Biden said: \'I just want to finish the job. And I think we can do that in the next six years.\' Share or comment on this article: Biden says Ukraine is \'NOT ready\' for entry into NATO as he departs for 2023 summit in Lithuania e-mail 7 shares Add comment Comments 265 Share what you think Newest Oldest Best rated Worst rated View all The comments below have not been moderated.

(2215, '14-Mistakes-People-Make-When-Using-Garlic', '14 Mistakes People Make When Using Garlic', 'There are many ways to prepare garlic, so there are many ways this preparation can go wrong. That\'s right, using garlic isn\'t as easy as you may think.', 'If you look in most kitchens, one of the staples that you\'re likely to find is garlic. Garlic is used when making many recipes, from to spaghetti sauce to , and so many more. Depending on how much garlic you add to a recipe, it can really pack a punch. But when used in smaller quantities, it can help add a nice flavor. There are many ways to prepare garlic, so there are many ways this preparation can go wrong. That\'s right, using garlic isn\'t as straightforward as you may think. Depending on the specific mistake you make, you could end up changing the way a recipe is supposed to taste or depriving yourself of some of the health benefits associated with cooking with garlic. You may even end up making more work for yourself in the kitchen, which is never a good thing. If you\'re ready to stop making mistakes when cooking with garlic or want to learn some tips to help improve your recipes, keep reading. If you\'re at the grocery store or farmer\'s market shopping for garlic, it\'s important to know how to identify fresh garlic. One of the first things you\'ll want to do is grab one of the bulbs and squeeze it gently. If you feel too much give, or it feels as if some of the cloves are hollowed out or overly dry, put the bulb down. These are both signs that the garlic is not fresh. Similarly, any cloves that have started sprouting should also be avoided — they are likely too old. Instead, a fresh garlic bulb should feel rather firm. When you squeeze it, it should not have much give. The ideal choice is to look for locally-grown garlic. It won\'t have traveled long distances to make it to your grocery store, which means it is much more likely to be fresh. You\'ve undoubtedly walked by the jars of garlic at your grocery store. Perhaps, you even bought them a few times so that you could still cook with full cloves of garlic without having to deal with the hassle of peeling them. However, this is a mistake that you won\'t want to make again. There are several reasons why it is best to stay away from jarred garlic. First, the flavor of jarred garlic just doesn\'t compare to that of fresh garlic. This is because garlic gets more pungent as soon as it is cut. With jars of previously minced garlic, the flavor of your will be more muted when combined with your dish. Another reason to stay away from jarred garlic is that it\'s pasteurized. When it is pasteurized, the garlic also loses more of its nutritional value. It also tends to be more expensive. Plus, because the taste isn\'t as strong, you\'re also likely to end up using more, which can make it even more costly to buy your garlic in the jarred format. If you\'re going to cook with garlic, you need to know how to peel it. Fortunately, it isn\'t too hard , as long as you know what you\'re doing. There is no need to use your fingers or a knife and you shouldn\'t end up smelling like garlic. One of the best — and easiest — ways to peel garlic barely requires you to touch the cloves at all. Start by pressing the palm of your hand down on the center of the garlic bulb. This will cause the individual cloves to easily separate. Then, place the cloves in a big bowl or a large mason jar — there should be a lot of extra room. Cover the bowl with a plate or place the lid on the mason jar. Use your hands to shake it for about 30 seconds. Make sure you\'re shaking pretty vigorously, or this approach will not work. When you remove the plate or lid, all of the garlic cloves should be peeled, and you\'ll just need to remove the skin. If they\'re not all peeled, return the lid or plate and give it all a few more shakes. If you have a garlic press, you might want to stop relying on it so heavily when adding garlic to a recipe. When you press garlic, you\'re left with numerous tiny chunks that are distributed throughout the dish you\'re cooking. One would think that this would result in a more mild flavor since the garlic isn\'t concentrated in any one area. However, this is not actually what happens. When garlic gets pressed into tiny pieces, it actually makes the flavor more intense, which can even end up overpowering the other ingredients in your recipe. Another reason to avoid using a garlic press is that it can alter the texture of the dish. Additionally, it could make it more likely to burn when you\'re sautéing it than if it had been minced or chopped. Now that it has been established that pressing garlic is a mistake, you have probably realized that mincing it is the best tactic. Luckily, it isn\'t too difficult. After peeling the garlic cloves, use a knife to trim off the dark edge of the clove and then thinly slice them. After slicing, you\'re ready to start mincing. Hold the knife at a slight angle, keeping one hand on the handle and the other on the top edge of the blade. Rock the handle back and forth to move the blade over the garlic. Continue repeating this motion until the garlic is minced into fine pieces. After you\'ve finished mincing garlic cloves for your recipe, the best choice is to let them rest for a few minutes before actually adding them to the pot or pan. Garlic cloves contain allicin, a compound that has been shown to help boost the immune system. When you let the garlic rest, it gives allicin and other sulfide compounds a chance to develop more fully, which can maximize their health benefits. The reason that allicin and other sulfide compounds develop more fully when chopped garlic sits is due to the chemical reaction that occurs between the oxygen in the air and the enzymes that are released. It doesn\'t take long for this reaction to occur. A 10-minute rest should be sufficient. Many people think that they have to peel garlic cloves before putting them into a press. However, adding the extra step of peeling the clove is actually unnecessary. When you put an unpeeled clove of garlic in your garlic press, it will actually press the garlic through the clove and onto your cutting board or into your pan. The peel of the garlic is left inside the press, and all you need to do is remove it. If you\'ve been taking the time to peel each clove, now you can start thinking about what you\'ll do with all the extra time on your hands in the kitchen. With all of this talk about selecting, peeling, pressing, and mincing garlic, is any of it really necessary when you can just go to the grocery store and pick up a bottle of garlic powder that will last for a long time? While there are some times when this can certainly come in handy — such as when making a dry rub or a dip — it should not be seen as a suitable substitute for fresh garlic. To make garlic powder, fresh garlic is dried and ground down. This process alters the flavor, making it much more mild and not as flavorful. If a recipe calls for fresh garlic cloves, or you really want to be able to taste the garlic in each bite, don\'t even think about substituting garlic powder. It just won\'t be the same, and you\'ll end up disappointed with the finished dish. While it may seem easier or quicker to use a microplane grater to finely chop each garlic clove, doing so isn\'t a good idea. Just as using a press can result in a very overpowering garlic flavor in your dish, the same is true when you use a microplane. The reason for this is that using this tool causes more molecules in the garlic to rupture. The more molecules that are ruptured, the stronger the garlic flavor is going to end up being. If you want to ensure that your recipes have a nice garlic flavor, without it being completely overpowering, it is best to stick with mincing. Burning garlic is another mistake that you will want to avoid. Burnt garlic isn\'t going to smell particularly pleasant and certainly won\'t contribute the flavors you were hoping for in your finished recipe. he small bits produced by mincing and pressing are even more likely to burn, so you\'ll definitely want to be careful when cooking them and aim to add them after your other ingredients have had time to cook. Adding garlic to the pan too early isn\'t the only thing that can make it more likely to burn. Getting the pan too hot may also contribute to the problem. To further minimize the chances of burning your garlic, don\'t cook it over high heat; medium or even low should be sufficient. If needed, increase the burner temperature when you\'re almost finished cooking. You can also help reduce the risk of ending up with burned garlic by cooking it in fat, such as oil or butter. Some people use the terms \"garlic clove\" and \"garlic head\" interchangeably. However, they are not the same thing, and confusing them when preparing a recipe could have disastrous results. A head of garlic refers to the entire bulb or group of segments stuck together; this is what you purchase at a grocery store. A clove of garlic, on the other hand, refers to just one of the segments from the head. These segments separate from one another if you press down on the top of the head or pull them off individually. Each one is made up of several cloves. So, as you can imagine, it would be a pretty big mistake to use an entire head of garlic if the recipe calls for a clove. Your recipe is likely to turn out very overpowering and unenjoyable. Sometimes a recipe may call for garlic powder. If you have fresh garlic on hand, you may want to substitute it in the recipe to help boost its flavor. Before you can do this, however, you need to understand how much fresh garlic you will need to use in place of the garlic powder. A general conversion to keep in mind is that each garlic clove, on average, equals 1/8 teaspoon of garlic powder. So, if you\'re looking to replace garlic powder with fresh garlic, aim to add approximately eight cloves for each teaspoon that the recipe calls for. If you\'ve never tried roasting garlic, then that is a mistake that you\'ll want to remedy as soon as possible. Roasting garlic is easy and yields a truly tasty treat. All you need to do is peel off the thinner layers covering the head of garlic (do not peel each individual clove). Then, cut off about 1/4-inch from the top of the cloves to expose their insides. Put each cut head into a muffin pan — with the cut side up — drizzle a little olive oil over the heads, and cover them with aluminum foil. Bake in a 400-degree Fahrenheit oven for about 35 minutes. After the garlic has finished roasting, you can actually eat it straight away. The chemical structure of the garlic is changed during the roasting process, leaving it milder and easier to digest. While it is good on its own, but roasted garlic can also be used for a variety of other recipes, including adding it to pasta dishes, mixing it into your mashed potatoes, making homemade hummus, and preparing garlic bread. Beyond its pleasant taste, eating can also be good for your heart and may help to control blood pressure. When combined with a balanced diet, it may also help to bring down cholesterol levels. Eating roasted garlic may also help protect you against certain types of cancer, improve digestive symptoms, and boost your immune system. If you do not store your garlic properly, then it isn\'t going to remain fresh as long. One of the most important things to remember is that it should be kept dry. If the garlic gets wet, it can rot and become moldy. For this reason, you should never store it in the refrigerator with your other vegetables. Instead, the best place to store garlic is in a dark and dry cabinet. Before putting it in the cabinet, place the head of garlic in a small paper bag. Alternatively, you can also leave it on the counter with onions and other produce that doesn\'t need to be refrigerated — just be sure to keep it away from anything wet. If you keep your garlic stored properly, you may find that it lasts for months. There are many advantages to storing your garlic correctly.', 'https://www.thedailymeal.com/img/gallery/14-mistakes-people-make-when-using-garlic/l-intro-1688141951.jpg', NULL, 'https://www.thedailymeal.com/1328212/mistakes-people-make-when-using-garlic/', '2023-07-09 08:45:49', 'united states of america', NULL, '2023-07-09 17:09:57', '2023-07-09 17:09:57', 2, 'Cooking;Tips', 'kitchener', 0),

At that time, the home was bought by investors who changed the infamous property’s address and — given the high-profile nature of JonBenét Ramsey’s murder — made a number of other landscape changes over potential privacy issues. Meanwhile, the Milners bought the home for around $1 million in 2004 and listed it for sale in 2008, 2009, and 2011, for a bit more than $2 million, and again in 2014 for a bit less than $2 million. According to Velvet Ropes , the exterior of the home looks much the same as it did when the property was thrust into the spotlight during the height of the Ramsey murder spectacle, but the interior of the home has been completely redone. It’s now surrounded by tall trees and protected by an iron gate. Supporting the almost $7 million asking price, the multi-level home — made from red brick and white stucco — sits in one of the nicest areas of Boulder, near the University of Colorado Boulder and Boulder’s Chautauqua Park. It’s decked out with a media room, wet bar, wine cellar, and gourmet kitchen.

I know that those beans traveled far, and were cared for.', 'Coffee fruit dries in the late-afternoon sun on a farm in the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais. Lucas Neves hide caption I have a kind of reverence for the coffee bean. Nearly every family trip we went on when I was a kid was spent flying across the planet from Boston to Rio de Janeiro, where almost my entire extended family lives. There aren\'t many coffee farms in the humid tropical climate of Rio, but if you drive out eight to 12 hours to the tiny town where my grandparents grew up in the state of Minas Gerais, you\'ll find arid rolling hills as far as you can see. That\'s where my cousins on my mom\'s side live, work and grow coffee. That trek — a five-hour flight, then an eight-hour flight, then a road trip — was always just the lead-up to the last leg of the journey. We\'d take the exhausted car and its passengers off the cobblestone streets, down a dirt road and to the top of a hill, where in my cousin\'s kitchen there would be at any hour of day or night some pão de queijo (or some cake) and a freshly poured thermos. Coffee fruit up close. Each one is a bit smaller than a cherry tomato. Lucas Neves hide caption We\'d drink the coffee out of little glass cups and finally get to work catching up and telling stories to one another. My parents would sit by the wood stove, and my brother and I would sometimes wander out while the adults were talking to chase the chickens and throw around a lemon like a tennis ball for the farm dogs to fetch. Coffee in Minas is usually served sickly sweet, but never with milk, and never iced, even in the middle of summer. Once the stars came out, we\'d soak them in until the air got cold, and then we\'d squeeze ourselves by the wood stove with another cup and feel a warm certainty that the coffee thermos must be bigger on the inside. Most of the highest-quality beans in Minas Gerais are sold abroad. When I was a kid especially, there wasn\'t really a coffee culture in Brazil the way there is in New York or Boston — that third-wave coffee culture that has a kind of purist bent to it, mindful of the \"notes\" in the brew. My coffee ritual these days: First, make sure you buy some actually nice coffee! I swear it\'s worth it. For brew method, lately I use a French press. Pour 60 mL (about 1/4 cup) water over the beans, stir and start timer. Let it bloom for 30 seconds; then pour the rest of the water to 250 mL (about 1 cup) and place the lid on the top. When the timer hits 4 minutes, gently press the plunger down and pour the coffee out into a cup. I like to drink it with 1/2 teaspoon of granulated sugar (I am not a purist! Only a ritualist). Enjoy on a comfortable perch, like a window with a view or a porch swing. But in college, I worked at a cafe that served the snooty tourists, students and professors in Harvard Square. And there I was taught to notice all those things I\'d never learned about coffee, even though I\'d seen the coffee fruit on the trees and watched firsthand as my cousins spread the fruit onto big, wavy multicolored sheets under the sun to dry. I learned then that my cousins\' process for preparing coffee was just one of many ways to do it — you could dry it in the sun or in a big machine, or it could be fermented, or washed first. All these methods could change the way the coffee tasted. I also learned that different regions have different taste profiles; some countries tend to be brighter, some earthier, some more complex or fruity. Brazil tends to be pretty soft, but more chocolatey and rich, like bourbon. I learned to think about tasting coffee as playing a word-association game. What does it make you think of? What memory comes up for you? Is there citrus? Or wood smoke? A coffee farm. Lucas Neves hide caption Today when I get up and make my first cup of coffee, I do it like performing a sacred ritual. I know that those beans traveled far, and were cared for. They were grown, and watered, and dried, and then roasted. Someone probably lost sleep over them when frost was in the forecast. It only feels right to me to measure out the beans on a scale, and grind them fresh, and make sure to let the beans bloom a bit before pouring the rest of the water over them. And when I take my first sip, I make sure to let my brain go blank, listen to the coffee and see where it takes me. What are you really into?

Chartered accountant turned entrepreneur Kartik Gaggar’s online art learning start-up Rooftop allows you to do just that. Through its live workshops and curated courses, Rooftop has organised over 2,000 art experiences, featuring the expertise of more than 2,100 master artists. It has a membership of 42,800+ participants hailing from over 20 countries worldwide and opened up a new canvas of learning for art enthusiasts. How did a CA who articled with PwC get into the space of art? Gaggar says he harboured a profound passion for the arts from a young age. In the sea of online learning ventures, he spotted a gap in the realm of Indian arts and crafts education, and decided to bridge the gap between aspiring learners and the cultural custodians. At first, he initiated a Facebook page where like-minded individuals could partake in immersive ‘art experiences’ — city walks and art tours that unveiled the hidden artistry thriving within localities. At one point, he held such walks in Jaipur, Jodhpur and Udaipur. During the course of his research, Gaggar embarked on a transformative journey, engaging with artists and started documenting their creative processes. This odyssey eventually birthed the ‘Circle Community’ in 2020. However, destiny had its own plans as the world faced the pandemic. Gaggar swiftly adapted to the circumstances. “I consider those periods as moments of growth,” he reflects. Henceforth, his brainchild was christened ‘Rooftop’ — a place where families often congregate to learn, play, eat or chat. The platform’s original vision was to “establish an exclusive community that united local artisans, providing them with a platform to showcase their artistry.” Gaggar says that Rooftop app is owned by a bootstrapped company called Slo-Mo Experiences. The platform was launched with an investment of ₹2.5 crore and ever since its launch, it has witnessed a 5x year-on-year growth. “In January 2022, Rooftop launched the updated version of its app. In the first six months of FY23-24, the app aims to have a turnover of ₹4-5 crore and then scale it further,” says a company statement. Rooftop operates on a subscription and pay-as-you-go model for its art workshops. Gaggar elaborates on the revenue streams, stating, “Apart from collaborating with businesses for workshops, our primary source of income stems from course sales.” He highlights the prominence of ‘Maestro courses’ as one of their flagship offerings. “These maestro courses, meticulously curated by award-winning veteran artists, boast over 10 hours of recorded content. By embarking on these courses, participants not only master traditional art forms but also immerse themselves in the rich tapestry of tradition and culture underlying them,” Gaggar reveals. Moreover, Rooftop actively engages with corporate entities operating under a B2B model that centres around fostering employee engagement through art-related activities. Since its inception, Rooftop has garnered interest not only from art enthusiasts but also from prominent governmental bodies such as the Tourism Department and the Ministry of Culture. As part of the ‘Startup India Innovation Week 2022’, Gaggar presented policy recommendations in the Travel and Tourism sector on the theme ‘Local to Glocal’ in a virtual meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Rooftop has even signed MoUs with Manipal University, Jaipur and collaborated with top institutes like Sir JJ School of Arts, Nottingham Trent University, UK, and Jamia Millia Islamia University, Delhi. “We even conducted workshops for Google and have collaborations with Genpact and Bain Capital,” Gaggar adds. He envisions a platform that empowers art lovers to access immersive art workshops on-the-go while simultaneously enabling artisans to forge alternative sources of income. “Our future endeavours aim to establish art as an asset class model,” says Gaggar.

Child abuse in the Western Cape was thrust into the spotlight last week when a woman was arrested and charged for pouring boiling water over 5-year-old Unako Kala while he was apparently playing with dogs in her street. The child sustained several burn wounds. Asanda Makaluza, a 22-year-old woman from Langa, was arrested in connection with the assault. According to police spokesperson Captain FC van Wyk, the assault took place on Saturday, 24 June. The boy\'s aunt, Yonela Mnyombolo, said Unako was recovering well. READ | Woman arrested for burning a child with boiling water \"He is doing much better,\" she said, recalling the day when he came home screaming and crying. \"[He had] open wounds from where the water was poured onto him. Mnyombolo said: According to the aunt, Unako left their Zone 17 home to play with his neighbourhood friends at the park in Settlers Street, which is where the accused lives. \"When it was time to come home, the children walked up the street,\" said Mnyombolo. She said the children were distracted by dogs in the street and wanted to play with them, but the dogs kept barking at them. It was then that the woman allegedly poured a bucket of boiling water over the child. \"We went to her place to ask her why she did this to our boy,\" said an angry Mnyombolo. Echoing the family\'s version of events, ward councillor Lwazi Phakade said: \"Children love playing with animals, and they found the dogs amusing while walking home from playing in the park. Somehow between the boy playing with the dogs and the dogs barking, Asanda might have found that irritating and acted in a manner that is condemned,\" Phakade said. \"We understand the community is still angry at what happened to the child. Any act of violence is condemned in the highest form, and we must allow the law to take its course in this case,\" said Phakade. He said scores of residents protested outside the Bishop Lavis Magistrate\'s Court on Friday where Makaluza appeared on a charge of intent to do grievous bodily harm. \"We were told she had been taken to Pollsmoor prison until her next court appearance. She is currently still behind bars,\" Phakade said. READ | \'Our boy is not doing well\': Family of toddler burnt with boiling water at creche struggle with medical bills The boy\'s family said they had received no apology from the accused or her family. \"Unako now has to walk around with those visible scars on his little body, which is wrong. He did not deserve to have that hot water poured on him like his life didn\'t matter,\" Mnyombolo said. The boy\'s assault is not an isolated crime. According to the most recent quarterly crime statistics , there were 419 cases of assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm on children in the Western Cape between January and March. During the same period, 39 children were murdered, and 81 attempted murder cases were opened. Marguerite Holtzhausen, director at The Trauma Centre, said the reasons why someone might perpetrate violence against a child could range from mental health issues to substance abuse. Holtzhausen said: However, Holtzhausen flagged that mental health was often a contributing factor in cases such as these. \"There are lots of reasons why people act the way they do. It\'s an individual diagnosis.\" Holtzhausen believed that one way of stemming the violence was to work with children at schools. She said it was important to look at where the violence came from. \"We know that many who perpetrate violence have childhood trauma. We have to look at the root causes,\" she said, adding that many South Africans live in a perpetual state of \"fight or flight\". \"We have intergenerational trauma. Look at our history as a country. That has never been dealt with. We don\'t have programmes where we focus on community healing,\" she said. Holtzhausen said children were often placed in danger because they did not have safe spaces to play. \"Young children are often on the streets, running free, with no supervision. They have no proper spaces to play, and no one is watching them,\" she said. Edith Kriel, director of child protection organisation Jelly Beanz, said many South Africans were \"living in survival mode on a daily basis\", with no room for empathy or kindness. In addition, children\'s rights were still grossly undervalued in many communities, Kriel said. \"Children are still not seen as people in their own right. There\'s very little understanding or compassion for them as human beings,\" she said. ALSO READ | Their 3-year-old died during power cuts. They think it may be time for City Power to pay Kriel said preventing child abuse required a systemic shift, which included providing social support to parents. \"Due to the legacy of apartheid, there\'s so much brokenness in families, parenting and parenting abilities. How are we really supporting families? The best the government has done is create the childcare grant. But that\'s just money, and it often doesn’t even get beneficiaries to the end of the month,\" Kriel said. Child rights activist Lucinda Evans described the case as \"shocking\", saying that she hoped the law would take its course. She added that women and mothers needed more support and services, especially if they were struggling with mental health issues. \"What more can we do to protect children? Do we have enough facilities and after-school programmes? The answer is no,\" Evans said. Department of Social Development spokesperson Monique Mortlock-Malgas said they aware of the matter and a social worker from a partner non-government organisation has been in touch with the family of the child. \"Psycho-social support will be rendered if necessary,\" said Malgas.', 'https://scripts.24.co.za/img/sites/news24.png', NULL, 'https://www.news24.com/news24/SouthAfrica/News/we-need-to-look-at-the-root-causes-child-protection-experts-call-for-urgent-action-20230710', '2023-07-10 00:30:24', 'south africa', NULL, '2023-07-10 07:00:04', '2023-07-10 07:00:04', 2, NULL, '', 0),

The Polish world number one had reached the fourth round without losing a set but faced a tough battle against the Swiss 14th seed on Centre Court.

According to The Verge, Google’s AI tool — Med-PaLM 2 (a variant of PaLM 2), has been in testing at the Mayo Clinic (a non-profit organisation based in the US) research hospital, among others, since April. The Wall Street Journal first reported the news. PaLM 2 is the language model underpinning Google’s Bard. According to the report, the tech giant believes that its improved model will be especially useful in places with “more limited access to doctors”. Google believes Med-PaLM 2 will be better at healthcare conversations than generalised chatbots such as Bard, Bing, and ChatGPT because it was trained on a curated set of medical expert demonstrations. Moreover, the report mentioned that the customers testing Med-PaLM 2 will control their data, which will be encrypted, and Google won’t have access to it. As per Google’s senior research director Greg Corrado, Med-PaLM 2 is still in its early stages. Corrado stated that, while he would not want it to be a part of his own family’s “healthcare journey”, he believes Med-PaLM 2 “takes the places in healthcare where AI can be beneficial and expands them by 10-fold”. Meanwhile, Google has updated its privacy policy, stating that it can use publicly available data to help train its artificial intelligence (AI) models. The tech giant changed the wording of its policy over the weekend and switched “AI models” for “language models”.

In a statement, the Corporation said that it is working as quickly as possible to establish the facts against the allegations that the presenter had paid a teenager 35,000 pounds for sexually explicit photos. BBC officials are slated to meet the Metropolitan Police on Monday to discuss the matter. The matter came to light after the Sun tabloid in a report on July 7 claimed that a woman had accused the presenter of paying her teen child for sexually explicit photographs. Neither the Sun, nor the BBC have named the presenter. In a new story, published by the Sun on Sunday evening, the tabloid claimed that the presenter made two “panicked calls” to the teenager following the July 7 report. The presenter allegedly asked the young person “what have you done” and asked them to ring their mother to get her to “stop the investigation”, the paper said. In a statement earlier on Sunday, the BBC said it was working as fast as possible “to establish the facts in order to properly inform appropriate next steps”. “The BBC first became aware of a complaint in May. New allegations were put to us on Thursday (July 6) of a different nature and in addition to our own enquiries we have also been in touch with external authorities, in line with our protocols.” It added that the corporation expected to be in a position to provide a further update on the process in the coming days. In an earlier statement on July 7, the BBC had said it has processes in place to deal with allegations and part of this is “actively attempting to speak to those who have contacted us in order to seek further detail and understanding of the situation”. “If we get no reply to our attempts or receive no further contact that can limit our ability to progress things but it does not mean our enquiries stop. “If, at any point, new information comes to light or is provided — including via newspapers — this will be acted upon appropriately, in line with internal processes,” added the BBC. In an email to staff, BBC Director General Tim Davie said such allegations were taken “incredibly seriously” and described the situation as “complex”. He added that the Corporation was working rapidly on ascertaining the facts and “to ensure that these matters are handled fairly and with care”.

Her meltdown led to 25,000 Ofcom complaints, with viewers furious at the foul-mouthed tirade she aimed at Teddy. Last night host Maya Jama asked Faye if she was still single and was met with a coy pause which suggested Faye might have found someone new. Back in April, Faye confirmed she was single in a fan Q&A on Instagram. She replied to a query about single life: “It’s single. But it’s a time to be me, learn to love me and take time for myself and only myself.” It came after Faye suggested that hunk Teddy had been messaging other girls behind her back.

LEEDS: Australia captain Pat Cummins insisted all options remained open as he refused to rule out dropping struggling opener David Warner for the finale of the Ashes series. Left-handed opener Warner has signalled his intention to retire from Test duty against Pakistan at his Sydney home ground next year. But the 36-year-old may yet be denied the chance to go out on his own terms after another double failure against longstanding England nemesis Stuart Broad during Australia\'s three-wicket defeat in the third Ashes Test at Headingley completed Sunday. Warner managed scores of just four and one at Leeds, falling to Broad on both occasions with the seamer now having dismissed him 17 times in his Test career. Although Australia lead the five-match Ashes 2-1, Warner has failed to fire in a series where he averages a meagre 23.50 with just one fifty from six innings. Warner\'s lack of runs has left Australia with a tricky decision in the nine days before the fourth Test at Old Trafford gets underway, although the fact there are no tour games makes it harder for the likes of reserve batsman Marcus Harris to press their case. Another way in which Warner could be omitted is if Mitchell Marsh, who marked his first Test since 2019 with a superb 118 and two wickets as an injury stand-in for Cameron Green, is retained alongside his fellow all-rounder, expected to be fit to play in Manchester. \'Deep breath\' Asked if Warner could be left out to accommodate both Marsh and Green in Australia\'s XI, Cummins replied: \"We\'ll keep all our options open.

DUBAI: Director Nitesh Tiwari on Sunday said \"Bawaal\" is a special coming-of-age film as it derives a lot from his personal life experiences. Starring Varun Dhawan and Janhvi Kapoor, the romance drama revolves around a high school history teacher Ajay \'Ajju\' Dixit, who enjoys a mini celebrityhood in his hometown. The film navigates the World War II trail in Europe and shows the lead couple struggle with their marriage, forcing Ajay to confront his internal war. The trailer of \"Bawaal\" was launched here at the iconic ocean line and hotel Queen Elizabeth II. \"This film is very special probably because there is a lot of personal stuff involved in it. This is the story which needs to be told. It is all about the way we look at life, the way we look at people. There are certain life experiences which change us. It is (about) coming-of-age and a layered piece emotionally,\" Nitesh said at the global press event. \"Bawaal\" was shot across various locations in India and overseas, including Poland, Netherlands and Germany. Some of the scenes in the trailer feature sequences of the Auschwitz concentration camp. WATCH TRAILER | Without divulging details about the connection of the Second World War with the film, the director said he has tried to incorporate chapters from history which contribute to the arc of the film\'s lead characters. \"I like to keep my cards close to my chest. The idea of the trailer is to create curiosity. Please watch the movie for all your answers. I\'ve kept the incidents and events, which kind of play an important role in the arc of the characters and their relationships in the movie. Every incident has been carefully chosen. World War II is humongous, there is so much to say,\" he added. Known for critical and commercial hit films such as \"Dangal\" and \"Chhichhore\", Nitesh said he hopes \"Bawaal\" will both entertain and urge people to \"reset priorities\". \"A movie should not get over when it gets over. A part of it should remain with you, when you finish it. That is what I\'ve been trying to do with all my films. I hope \'Bawaal\' will not only entertain you but will also make you take a pause and reset your priorities,\" he said. The biggest challenge, according to the director, was to come up with a story. He credited his wife, writer-director Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari, for coming up with a powerful script like \"Bawaal\". \"I\'m grateful to Ashwiny for writing the story and being generous enough to give it to me. I know how difficult it is for creators to part ways with their babies,\" he said. Nitesh Tiwari and Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari. Ashwiny, who is also co-producing the film via her and Nitesh\'s Earthsky Pictures along with Sajid Nadiadwala\'s Nadiadwala Grandsons, said \"Bawaal\" is also an ode to her father-in-law. \"Nitesh\'s father was an education head across Madhya Pradesh and a history teacher. Of course, he was not like a character which we have created for Varun. Papa always used to teach a lot of history and wanted to go across Europe. See and understand what actually happened in those places which he had read about. I was supposed to take him to Germany, (but) he fell sick and I couldn\'t take him to Germany. He is no more. \'Bawaal\' is also an ode to Nitesh\'s father,\" she added. The film also had Nitesh and Varun bond over their Kanpur connection, where they filmed the high school sequences, the actor said. \"Bawaal\" will release on Prime Video in India and across 200 countries and territories on July 21. Varun said it was a memorable experience to visit Kanpur and shoot in the same school where his father, filmmaker David Dhawan, studied as a child. \"The school in which Ajju is a teacher is actually the school where my father and my uncle studied. He was originally from Kanpur. We used to talk about it and reminisce about his days there,\" he said, adding that three of his most favourite directors -- Nitesh, \"Bhediya\" director Amar Kaushik, and his father are all from Kanpur. For Janhvi, visiting Auschwitz was an emotional experience. \"When we were in Poland, we went to see Auschwitz and it was a moving experience. It taught us a lot about the gravity of what we were speaking about in the film,\" the actor, who plays Nisha in \"Bawaal\", added. The trailer launch event was also attended by producers Sajid Nadiadwala, Warda Nadiadwala and Manish Menghani, director of content licensing, Prime Video India.', 'DUBAI: Director Nitesh Tiwari on Sunday said \"Bawaal\" is a special coming-of-age film as it derives a lot from his personal life experiences. Starring Varun Dhawan and Janhvi Kapoor, the romance drama revolves around a high school history teacher Ajay \'Ajju\' Dixit, who enjoys a mini celebrityhood in his hometown. The film navigates the World War II trail in Europe and shows the lead couple struggle with their marriage, forcing Ajay to confront his internal war. The trailer of \"Bawaal\" was launched here at the iconic ocean line and hotel Queen Elizabeth II. \"This film is very special probably because there is a lot of personal stuff involved in it. This is the story which needs to be told. It is all about the way we look at life, the way we look at people. There are certain life experiences which change us. It is (about) coming-of-age and a layered piece emotionally,\" Nitesh said at the global press event. \"Bawaal\" was shot across various locations in India and overseas, including Poland, Netherlands and Germany. Some of the scenes in the trailer feature sequences of the Auschwitz concentration camp. Without divulging details about the connection of the Second World War with the film, the director said he has tried to incorporate chapters from history which contribute to the arc of the film\'s lead characters. \"I like to keep my cards close to my chest. The idea of the trailer is to create curiosity. Please watch the movie for all your answers. I\'ve kept the incidents and events, which kind of play an important role in the arc of the characters and their relationships in the movie. Every incident has been carefully chosen. World War II is humongous, there is so much to say,\" he added. Known for critical and commercial hit films such as \"Dangal\" and \"Chhichhore\", Nitesh said he hopes \"Bawaal\" will both entertain and urge people to \"reset priorities\". \"A movie should not get over when it gets over. A part of it should remain with you, when you finish it. That is what I\'ve been trying to do with all my films. I hope \'Bawaal\' will not only entertain you but will also make you take a pause and reset your priorities,\" he said. The biggest challenge, according to the director, was to come up with a story. He credited his wife, writer-director Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari, for coming up with a powerful script like \"Bawaal\". \"I\'m grateful to Ashwiny for writing the story and being generous enough to give it to me. I know how difficult it is for creators to part ways with their babies,\" he said. Ashwiny, who is also co-producing the film via her and Nitesh\'s Earthsky Pictures along with Sajid Nadiadwala\'s Nadiadwala Grandsons, said \"Bawaal\" is also an ode to her father-in-law. \"Nitesh\'s father was an education head across Madhya Pradesh and a history teacher.

The airport arrest was made by Civil Guard officers around 11am local time the same morning. The unnamed suspect is expected to appear in court later today following a night in a police cell so a judge can decide how to proceed. Detectives have not yet made any official comment. In May a British tourist was arrested and thrown in jail on suspicion of raping a female friend of his son’s at a hotel in Magaluf. The holidaymaker was also held at Palma Airport after allegedly packing his bags and trying to leave the island in a hurry hours later. The woman, also believed to be British, told detectives she was forced to have sex after falling asleep in her friend’s room which had an internal door leading into his dad’s room.

At least 342 drug-related killings were recorded from July 1, 2022 to June 30, 2023, according to the Dahas Project of the University of the Philippines’ Third World Studies Center. Out of this total, 115 were killed during anti-illegal drug operations conducted by the government, including the Philippine National Police (PNP). This number increases to 146 to include those killed by state agents outside of anti-illegal drug operations, but were later found to have links to illegal drugs. The Dahas project monitors drug-related killings reported in the media across the Philippines. These sources, including news reports from regional newspapers, are publicly posted on the project’s website . The number monitored by Dahas is significantly higher than what the PNP provided to Rappler. In response to a separate freedom of information request lodged on Wednesday, July 5, the National Operations Support Unit (NOSU) of the PNP Drug Enforcement Group (DEG) said that “FIVE (5) is the total number of people killed in illegal drugs” from July 2022 to June 2023. DEG is the unit that leads the anti-illegal drug efforts of the national police. The number provided by the PNP to Rappler is significantly different from what its own chief said in November 2022. In a forum by the Foreign Correspondents Association of the Philippines, then-PNP chief Rodolfo Azurin Jr. said that 46 people were already killed in anti-illegal drug operations by the state – 32 by police and 14 by PDEA agents. Rappler reached out to get the PNP’s side through its Public Information Office through email and a text message to spokesperson Police Colonel Jean Fajardo on Thursday, July 6, but has yet to receive a reply. We will update this story once we get a statement. Marcos administration ‘being even more opaque’ During the Duterte years, the PNP and the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency released numbers online through the #RealNumbersPH platform on Facebook. While these numbers are heavily contested, it provided the public a view of the violence that the government perpetrated since coming into power in 2016. The Dahas project is the only one, if not one of the remaining efforts, to monitor the number of killings related to the war on drugs that continues well into the Marcos administration. A May 2023 report by the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights cited the Dahas project as an example of “bringing casualty recording to bear on further compliance with international human rights and humanitarian law.” Sol Iglesias, assistant professor of political science at the University of the Philippines Diliman, said that Dahas data is credible as they “follow a published method of data collection, in keeping with international standards in violence incident monitoring both in the academe and by other research institutions.” The same cannot be said about the data that the PNP provided to Rappler. The fact that the institution does not release any further information on the total number of killed in the past year – including the circumstances of the deaths – “just raises more questions than it answers.” “The government may be continuing the lack of transparency of the previous administration, or perhaps it is being even more opaque,” Iglesias told Rappler. “Under a climate of transparency, media or academic reports and official government sources should tally much more closely,” she added. Must Read More killings, no justice: Navigating continued impunity from Duterte to Marcos False image of the drug war Calls for transparency come as Marcos marks his first year in office without explicit efforts to stop the violent drug war beyond rhetoric. In the past, the President said he would be taking on a different approach since enforcement “ only gets you so far ” and that a “ focus on enforcement ” resulted in “abuses by certain elements in the government” during the Duterte years. Philippine Human Rights Information Center (PhilRights) executive director Nymia Pimentel-Simbulan said the lack of transparency coupled with continued violence on the ground shows that Marcos may not be deviating from Duterte, or at least in terms of policies. “The discrepancy in reported figures also indicates that the Marcos government is no different from its predecessor in disseminating lies and misinformation in order to project a false image of the drug war,” she told Rappler. PhilRights is a human rights organization that documented cases of killings under Duterte’s drug war while providing necessary assistance to families left behind. It has continued doing so under the new administration, with Simbulan noting that there have been many unreported killings. “That law enforcement agencies continue with this abhorrent practice only highlights the insincerity of the Marcos administration’s claims that its anti-illegal drug efforts are above board and respectful of rule of law and of human rights,” she said. – Rappler.com', NULL, NULL, 'https://www.rappler.com/nation/death-toll-drug-war-marcos-jr-first-year-office-dahas-project-2023/', '2023-07-10 02:14:04', 'philippines', NULL, '2023-07-10 08:00:03', '2023-07-10 08:00:03', 7, NULL, '', 0),

Reuters KEY POINTS Med-PaLM 2 is designed to answer medical questions and potentially even summarize medical data Google is also working with Mayo Clinic for a radiotherapy model Med-PaLM 2 scored 67.2% on a medical licensing exam dataset Search giant Google has reportedly been testing a medical chatbot since April as the company continues to work on artificial intelligence. Google\'s Med-PaLM 2, a version of the company\'s PaLM 2 large language model (LLM), has been going through tests at the Rochester-based Mayo Clinic and other unspecified hospitals, The Wall Street Journal reported. The medical chatbot, which was designed to answer medical questions, is expected to be particularly helpful in countries with \"more limited access to doctors,\" according to an internal email viewed by WSJ. The search engine behemoth believes Med-PaLM 2 will be better at handling healthcare conversations compared to the other chatbots used for general use such as Google\'s own Bard, Microsoft\'s Bing and OpenAI\'s ChatGPT. Providing an overview of Med-PaLM 2, Alan Karthikesalingam, a senior staff clinical research scientist at Google Health, revealed the chatbot was \"the first AI system to exceed the pass mark\" in multiple-choice medical licensing exam questions. Karthikelasingam said the passing mark for new doctors was \"often around 60%\" in U.S. medical licensing exams, while AI systems usually \"plateaued at 50.\" Google\'s medical LLM scored 67.2%. \'Useless\': Google Employees Criticize Bard Before ChatGPT Rival\'s Launch Read more \'Useless\': Google Employees Criticize Bard Before ChatGPT Rival\'s Launch The tech giant said in April it was looking to collaborate with Google Cloud customers on how the medical chatbot can be used to find insights \"in complicated and unstructured medical texts.\" The company hinted that Med-PaLM may also help with other tasks such as drafting \"short- and long-form responses and summarize documentation and insights from internal data sets and bodies of scientific knowledge.\" In a study published in May, Google provided information about the shortcomings of Med-PaLM. It found that the medical chatbot provided more inaccuracies and irrelevant information than those of doctors. On the other hand, Med-PaLM was able to perform more or less like actual doctors in terms of showing evidence of reasoning and providing consensus-supported answers. The AI chatbot also showed no sign of wrong comprehension. Greg Corrado, Google senior research director, reiterated Med-PaLM 2 is still in its early stages, adding that he wouldn\'t want the chatbot to be involved in his own family\'s healthcare journey. Still, Corrado believes the bot \"takes the places in healthcare where AI can be beneficial and expands them by 10-fold,\" WSJ reported. Google also revealed in mid-March that it will \"soon\" publish research findings on AI support for radiotherapy planning. Google said it was \"formalizing\" an agreement with Mayo Clinic \"to explore further research, model development and commercialization\" on the radiotherapy model. News of Google\'s medical chatbot come as other AI labs and companies race toward generative AI domination, with some also working on models for the medical field. A team at NYU Grossman School of Medicine unveiled a new AI tool last month that demonstrated the ability to interpret physicians\' notes and accurately anticipate a patient\'s risk of death and other information. In April, British experts developed an AI model that could detect cancer at the early stage, raising hopes for faster diagnosis and treatment among patients. Despite the promising potential of AI in healthcare, there are still concerns regarding clinical safety, ethical practices and accountability.

A major overhaul of the W14 introduced at the Monaco Grand Prix had initially appeared to give the squad the uptick in form it felt it needed to fight for wins, but it has failed to build on that early promise. And as it appears stuck in the chasing pack behind Red Bull, there is a growing acceptance that the team cannot make the changes it wants with the W14 that it feels is essential to close down the deficit to the front. That is why team boss Toto Wolff thinks the moment is nearing where Mercedes will have to accept that its future is better set throwing all its resources towards what is expected to be a fundamental redesign for next season. Asked by Autosport at what point that decision will be made, Wolff said “I think pretty soon. We have no choice. “P2 or P3 fundamentally doesn\'t impact me and the team. It\'s about coming back and being able to win a world championship in that respect. That\'s not going to happen this year. “So we need to set our eyes to next year and then, at all the races to come, learn and develop, and make sure that we can carry that forward into next year. “But, having said that, the regulations are the same. So it\'s not that you\'re not learning nothing by continuing this car. It\'s a balance that we have to strike right.” George Russell, Mercedes F1 W14 Photo by: Steve Etherington / Motorsport Images While McLaren’s amazing step forward this season has highlighted the potential for big gains, Mercedes does not see scope for it to do a similar step soon. Wolff said that limitations imposed by the cost cap, plus wind tunnel restrictions, leave his outfit only able to bring some minor improvements over the remainder of the campaign. “I think we are restricted by the cost cap and by the relative less amount in wind tunnel and CFD time that McLaren was able to have,” he explained.

So they carried over that more wind tunnel time allocation. And that\'s why it\'s kind of difficult. “Do I believe that we have upgrades in there that are going to fundamentally change the car? I don\'t believe so. But we have a few small steps that are to come. And you can see that if you find the tenth or two or three, it puts you in a different position on the grid.” Mercedes’ admission that thoughts will soon have to shift to 2024 come after a British GP weekend where the team had hoped to perform much better, as Silverstone’s high-speed swoops should have suited the car perfectly. Instead, it was McLaren that shone at the track. Toto Wolff, Team Principal and CEO, Mercedes-AMG Photo by: Michael Potts / Motorsport Images Wolff still believes that the squad can pull together a win to beat Verstappen at some point, but it is not going to be easy – especially as he thinks the current car is worse for his drivers than the infamous W08 from 2017 that earned the ‘Diva’ nickname. Wolff added: “I thought that Silverstone based on our historic performances was the best shot, but it wasn\'t. So maybe there\'s another track where we have the best shot because the characteristics of the car have changed. “I always believe that we can beat Max, we have a good group of people, and the best drivers. “We just have to give them a car that is more predictable, and not the Diva 2.0, plus much more complicated than the first one.” shares comments', 'https://cdn-7.motorsport.com/images/amp/YEQgnG5Y/s6/lewis-hamilton-mercedes-f1-w14.jpg', NULL, 'https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/mercedes-poised-to-switch-full-focus-to-2024-f1-car-and-abandon-diva-20/10494203/?utm_source=RSS&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=RSS-ALL&utm_term=News&utm_content=uk', '2023-07-10 02:58:39', 'united kingdom', NULL, '2023-07-10 09:30:01', '2023-07-10 09:30:01', 7, NULL, '', 0),

I lost positions instead of gaining, so it just made it harder, the recovery.” He collided with Nico Hulkenberg at one stage as he tried to make up ground. “We clipped, I think I was lucky to not get a puncture,” Perez said, calling it “a little race incident.” He lost further ground when he pitted shortly before the Safety Car was deployed. “I used too much my tyres on the first stint, and then we boxed I think three laps before the Safety Car. So it wasn’t meant to be, but in the end we we gave it all and we did what we possibly could.” Despite having fallen 99 points behind Verstappen in the championship, Perez remained upbeat about his chances over the remainder of the season. “We’re making a lot of progress because the pace is there on Sundays,” he said. “But it’s just the whole weekend overall. We’ve had a few bad weekends but at the end of the day it only matters where we finish in Abu Dhabi. “So it’s a long season still, and I fully believe that I can get my season back on-track.” RaceFans strives to bring its readers news directly from the key players in Formula 1.

Lakatos Oszkár értékelése szerint „a helyzet kritikus, szinte kilátástalan”. Mint fogalmaztak, az elnökhelyettes ezzel cáfolta a képviselők körében terjedő híreszteléseket, miszerint az ORÖ jelentős pénztartalékkal rendelkezik. Lakatos Oszkár levelében beszámolt arról a fejleményről is, amiről előző cikkünkben írtunk: bár a Belügyminisztérium megígérte, hogy legalább az ORÖ fenntartásában működő sziráki és tiszapüspöki iskola után járó állami támogatást átutalja, a gondoskodáspolitikáért felelős államtitkárság nem intézkedett annak érdekében, hogy az inkasszóval terhelt számláról az adóhatóság ne emelje le az összeget. NAV-végrehajtók rohanják le a fővárosi roma önkormányzatot – Több alkalommal telefonon is hívtam Radomszki Lászlóné helyettes államtitkár asszonyt, hogy a gondoskodáspolitikáért felelős államtitkárság mulasztása ellenére az utolsó pillanatban találjunk megoldást – írta képviselőtársainak Lakatos Oszkár. Azonban a helyettes államtitkár nem fogadta hívását és nem hívta vissza, ami Lakatos szerint „egyértelmű jelzés az ORÖ számára az államtitkársági hozzáállást, szándékot érintően”. Megjegyezte: csupán az inkasszó felfüggesztését kellett volna kérni, amíg az iskolák támogatása megérkezik rendeltetési helyére. Így viszont az iskolák nem jutottak hozzá a költségvetési pénzhez. Korábban az ORÖ elnökhelyettese lemondásra szólította fel Fülöp Attila gondoskodáspolitikáért felelős államtitkárt és Radomszki Lászlóné társadalmi felzárkózásért felelős helyettes államtitkárt. Vádat emeltek az Országos Roma Önkormányzat elnöke ellen: akár hat évre börtönbe kerülhet Mivel a Belügyminisztérium több mint 1 milliárd forintot követel az országos önkormányzattól, aligha lehet vitatkozni azzal megfogalmazással, hogy „a helyzet kritikus, szinte kilátástalan”. Főleg úgy, hogy jelen állás szerint az ORÖ nem kapja meg a harmadik negyedévre járó költségvetési támogatást – közölték. A minisztérium által megállapított tartozások még az előző önkormányzati ciklusban halmozódtak fel, és elsősorban a Farkas Flórián nevével fémjelzett Híd a munka világába programhoz kötődnek. Az ORÖ minden elemében vitatja a követelés jogosságát, és Lakatos Oszkár állítja, hogy a pénz jelentős részét már visszafizették. A bíróság azonban nem így gondolta, és első fokon hozott ítéletében egy több mint félmilliárdos tétel esetében a minisztériumnak adott igazat. Az ORÖ fellebbezett.

The film also invites an uncomfortable discussion among Black audiences.', 'Director So Yun Um says that Korean Americans don\'t often discuss anti-Blackness. With her new documentary, \"Liquor Store Dreams,\" she helps open the dialogue — including with her father, Hae Sup Um. Jacki Huntington Filmmaker So Yun Um and I are about 30 minutes deep into a discussion about the complicated relationship between Korean and Black Americans, particularly in Los Angeles, when she offers a memory. It’s about a Korean American friend of hers who was walking down the street in New York when a Black person held him up and stole his AirPods. It’s noticeably difficult for her to share — in part because of the racial trauma it elicits and because she acknowledges that anti-Blackness is prevalent in the Korean American community, and that experiences like this are too often seen as a validation for it. Advertisement “For him, I’m sure he’s thinking, Oh man, how do I not blame this? ” Um told me on a video call. “Sure, the person that attacked me was Black, but how do I not make it a blanket statement? Because I know that that is not correct, and it could be a one-off incident.” These are the types of complexities she also grapples with in “Liquor Store Dreams,” her feature directorial debut that is at once personal — she grew up the child of Korean immigrants who owned a liquor store — and expansive. It celebrates her history and community and both challenges it to unlearn ingrained stereotypes and invites wider audiences to see their humanity. “In the very beginning, my only goal was to make a film that was true and that is for Korean people,” Um said. “I never really thought or anticipated that the film would reach so far.” That’s the thing about filmmaking, though. Even the most specific story could have a profound effect on other viewers. Particularly, in this case, Black audiences that have skin in the narrative. Advertisement Um reexamines the murder of 15-year-old Latasha Harlins by Korean American store owner Soon Ja Du, pictured here, over a $1.79 bottle of orange juice. Ken Lubas via Getty Images “Liquor Store Dreams,” which premieres on PBS on July 10, could have really existed in any era. Most prominently, the 1991 murder of 15-year-old Black teenager Latasha Harlins by Korean American convenience store owner Soon Ja Du ignited distrust between Black and Korean American communities. That was followed the next year by the LA uprising , partly in response to Du avoiding jail time . But anti-Blackness, as well as anti-Asian racism, reached another high point in 2020 when both groups passionately advocated for their own humanity . By then, Um was one year into making her film. “A lot of the issues that we were dealing with in ’92 started coming back up — whether it’s anti-Blackness or prejudices or any traumas that people, Korean people, have felt back then,” Um said. With “Liquor Store Dreams,” the director, along with co-writer Christine Yun Kim, pulls back the pages of history and reflects on today’s not-unsimilar landscape, threading together deeply human stories of loss and self-examination throughout. Advertisement Harlins’ murder, the police beating of Rodney King , the uprising (commonly referred to by Koreans as Saigu ), the roughly 2,000 Korean-owned businesses that were damaged or destroyed, revived anti-Asian hate in 2020 and Black Lives Matter are all examined in the film. They’re woven among knotty discussions Um has with her family and other Korean American locals. With her new documentary, Um hopes to reframe the conversation around the relationship between Korean and Black Americans. Pictured: A local resident comforts a Korean American store owner after she returns to find her business looted and burned in South Central Los Angeles on April 30, 1992, during day two of the Los Angeles uprising. Steve Grayson via Getty Images These dialogues aren’t led by a person who claims to be well-versed in either the history of Korean-Black relations or even her own. Um was only 3 years old at the time of the uprising. But she’s always had a “passion for justice.” “It just started out young,” she said. “I was like, ugh, I just feel like everything is so unfair — and maybe I could attribute it to being bullied. So I’m like, how do I change things? How do I change things in my own way?” That frustration and fervor feel honest in the film and throughout our conversation. Becoming a filmmaker and making this movie seem to be a direct byproduct of those emotions. The film is also an opportunity for Um to discuss race with her community members, who, like her, did not grow up talking about it with their parents . The more she learned, the more she hoped to pass on to them. Advertisement “This was my chance to learn my own history,” she said. “Because I never took an Asian American studies class, which is probably the biggest thing that I regret. And so I was like, how do I learn all this? But from the people closest to me?” While she hadn’t studied her own history in school, she, like many other people of color, did get a pretty good understanding of how her community was seen through the eyes of American cinema. And, unsurprisingly, it wasn’t great. Flashes of scenes featuring a stereotypically racist Korean American convenience store owner are shown in “Liquor Store Dreams” — from “Menace II Society” and “Falling Down” to “Do the Right Thing.” These were the images that not only informed Yum, but non-Korean American audiences as well. Um revisited them, as well as films that deepened her understanding of Black history like 2019’s “The Dope Years: The Story of Latasha Harlins,” while researching for her own film. Um aimed to deepen her understanding of Black history and the stereotypical way Korean Americans have been portrayed in American films like \"Do the Right Thing,\" particularly in the aftermath of the Los Angeles uprising, while crafting a nuanced conversation about anti-Blackness in her own community. Pictured: An unhoused person sleeps at a bus stop in Los Angeles with graffiti stating \"Fuck the Police\" and referencing Rodney King and Latasha Harlins. Lindsay Brice via Getty Images Advertisement Admittedly, sequences like the one in “Menace” aren’t easy to watch in hindsight. They help normalize a stereotype. But, much like the story of Um’s friend’s assault, they are also necessary to engage in a contextualized conversation around anti-Blackness in her community. How does she feel about those images now as she reframes the relationship between Black and Korean people? I can tell that that isn’t easy for her to answer, even before she begins to speak “What’s hard is because some of those images are not far from reality,” she said. She remembered what it was like at her parents’ shop. “Sometimes when I was in the store, I could feel myself getting so angry, just because it is a place where so many things happen on a day-to-day basis.” One of those things is recalled in “Liquor Store Dreams.” She talks about her father being assaulted at the store when she was a child. Teenage girls had stolen some chips, and soon after, they spat on her father, Hae Sup Um, when he confronted them. Advertisement On our call, the director continued her thought with me: “I think that’s the hard part; you cannot control the environment that you’re in. I think that comes with any customer service business or encounter with people. And so, it’s really tough.” Korean American store owner May Park and her son Danny reexamine their relationships with the largely unhoused Black and brown community of Skid Row in \"Liquor Store Dreams.\" Dawn Shim Um understands that those images from films like “Do the Right Thing” are, while detrimental, “also part of entertainment.” But she saw a need to offer a fresh perspective. “Part of me, it’s like — OK, well, part fact, sure,” she said. “I could be angry about it, but what else am I going to do? I can add to the conversation. And for me, it’s like, well, why don’t I add to the conversation through this film and show a different side?” She pointed to Danny Park, for example, who’s also the adult child of Korean American parents who own a liquor store and shares his story in “Liquor Store Dreams.” He previously talked about his journey in Yum’s 2018 short film “Liquor Store Babies.” Advertisement After a stint at Nike, he returned to work at his parents’ store in Skid Row, where he effectively helped integrate the largely unhoused Black and brown community into the store and through events like Chuseok , a Korean celebration. He and other anti-racist Korean American activists, like a woman featured named Isabelle, counter the more popular image of Korean Americans that we’ve seen on screen. Isabelle, a woman “way older” than Um, was a pleasant surprise for the filmmaker, who had always felt that anti-Blackness was largely an issue among the older generation. “I think her words were, ‘Anti-Blackness is so toxic and pervasive in the Asian American community,’” Um recalled. “And I was like, whoa.” \"Black Lives Matter\" is written on the drum of a Korean musician at a peace rally on the 25th anniversary of the LA uprising. Warrick Page via Getty Images Advertisement For a long time, Um thought that younger Korean Americans were more aware of anti-Black racism because they have more access to the internet and that language. Isabelle changed that perspective for her. “She corrected me,” Um said. “She’s like, ‘No, it’s not an age thing.’ I think for her, she just had to learn and adapt. And also, she’s probably been exposed to different things.” It could also be that Isabelle was among the many Korean Americans, as Um noted, who became activated after the uprising. “I think a lot of us cite that [as when] we actually became American,” she said. “Until that point, we weren’t affected by the injustices of America — even how we were abandoned by the police when we felt like we were relying on the police for our protection.” That’s an experience Black Americans have always had. “I think that it was an awakening for a lot of our community,” Um continued, “that they started to realize, Oh, now we have to engag e.” Advertisement Um’s dad wasn’t among them, though. In one of the more difficult moments in “Liquor Store Dreams,” she has a heated discussion with him as he watches the Black Lives Matter protests on TV following the murder of George Floyd in 2020 . He reduces the turmoil to gratuitous theft. Filmmaker So Yun Um challenges her dad about anti-Blackness in one of the more difficult moments to watch in \"Liquor Store Dreams.\" Jacki Huntington The director plainly tells her father, “A life was taken,” adding that they’d also be mad if a Korean person was killed. To which he responds, “We don’t protest when our people die.” His response feels both belittling and willfully disempowering since every disadvantaged person has the right to protest — and that shouldn’t be criticized. Um worked with language justice translators from a group called Koreatown for Black Lives in order for her community to understand the film and particularly so that she could engage with her father, who speaks exclusively in Korean. While she knows the language, she hadn’t spoken it in so long that she needed help with it. Advertisement “Even when I was preparing to have that conversation with my dad, I just had to anticipate everything that he might say, and then I had to figure out how do I learn to say it back?” Um recalled. “Because if we’re going to fight, I need to be able to counterargue.” And that was necessary. Yum asks her dad, “What about Soon Ja Du?” and he replies that what happened to Harlins was because she allegedly stole a $1.79 bottle of orange juice. Even with this scene coming on the heels of the documentary’s earnest retelling of the Korean business owners impacted by the uprising, Hae Sup’s comments, while filled with personal pain, also reflect a refusal to see the same humanity in a Black teen that he sees in Du. People take part in a rally against anti-Asian hate crimes in San Mateo, California, on Feb. 27, 2021. Xinhua News Agency via Getty Images So, how does Um, who’s newly reckoning with these intertwined histories, confer with and educate her community about anti-Blackness while also addressing rampant anti-Asian hate ? Advertisement Um begins to answer the question carefully. “Because I don’t feel like there’s a really eloquent way to convey this message, but I also feel like I don’t have the right words and tools,” she begins. The filmmaker ultimately doesn’t see it as a binary. “They always say when you’re fighting against anti-Asian hate, [it] doesn’t mean that you have to be anti-Black, that you can be proactively fighting both [types of hate] at the same time,” she continued. “Because they’re rooted in the same concept and they’re all stemming from white supremacy in a sense.” It’s not “helpful,” she added, to disassociate the two issues, especially when they’re too often interlaced. That’s echoed by Pastor Q, a vocal Black fixture in the community who is also highlighted in “Liquor Store Dreams” and who explains that any animosity between the two marginalized groups only supports white supremacy. When it came to the moment in the film when Um had to challenge her father, though, it was difficult because of his own lived experiences. You can see that he gets more and more upset when she points out his disregard for racial context. He accuses his daughter of talking about what she doesn’t understand. Even Um concedes that “you cannot dispute somebody’s experience,” which shapes their perspective. The same can be said about how some Black people feel in the aftermath of Harlins’ death. Advertisement So, what can she learn from a father who doesn’t agree with the power of protesting for his own survival? What is the cultural nuance there that particularly Black audiences might find difficult to empathize with or understand? A shopping center at the intersection of Western Avenue and 6th Street is engulfed in flames in Koreatown during the third day of the 1992 Los Angeles uprising. Hyungwon Kang via Getty Images “I think for me, it has always been trying to figure out — OK, well true, when a lot of Asians do get attacked, either (1) we don’t talk about it or (2) what are we going to do about it?” Um said. “Can we even do anything about it? Because it feels like a systemic thing.” But rather than criticizing the white supremacy that has rendered this sense of futility, Black people became the ones to blame, Um further explained. “It’s like, well, the easiest thing is to blame the people,” she said. “Say, if they’re Black, it’s like, let’s blame Black people. And I think that it’s such an easy cop-out. Because, well, for one, it’s the actual person. They’re not thinking there’s bad people everywhere.” Advertisement There’s also more context overlooked here, as Um further expounded upon. Outside of housing the second-largest population of Koreans outside of Korea in the ’90s, LA’s Koreatown already had a huge Black community of residents and customers. When many Koreans immigrated to California, one of the few places they could get small business loans was in Central LA. That left the two marginalized groups dominating one area. “If you’re in a predominantly Black and brown neighborhood, if an accident were happening, who else would be the assailant?” Um asked. “It wouldn’t be a white person because a white person doesn’t live there.” But without that context, along with a siloed understanding of both communities, stereotypes ultimately formed. With that, Um thinks about her friend with the AirPods. She admits that it’s been “a process” for some Korean Americans to unlearn anti-Blackness, but one in which she’s invested. “So much of our immigrant parents come to America with this mindset of, ‘I’m going to assimilate. I’m going to be American,’\" Um said. \"And what is more American than being anti-Black?” Pictured: Korean American storeowners defend their property as gunfire breaks out in Koreatown on April 30, 1992, in Los Angeles. Hyungwon Kang via Getty Images That’s also attached to a long history of Asian American assimilation into white American culture — hence, how Hae Sup regards the criminal justice system and how many Asian Americans adopt the same ideologies of white oppressors. That often puts them in opposition to Black resistance. Advertisement Um noted that helping people to detach from that thinking and reeducate themselves has been part of that process. “I think that it’s been tough,” she admitted. “So much of our immigrant parents come to America with this mindset of, ‘I’m going to assimilate. I’m going to be American.’ And what is more American than being anti-Black?” That’s a troublesome, though crucial, point. “I think that is something that feels like so much of our system and the way that our city’s built,” Um went on, “the way that the freeways run, the way where we have access to water and food and things like that.” This kind of context and knowledge is also a privilege among people with less access to information. Convenience stores fall within that conversation. While much of “Liquor Store Dreams” reassesses the complicated history of anti-Blackness and mental health traumas among Korean Americans in LA, it also underscores the significance of stores like the ones Um’s and Park’s parents owned. Advertisement They represent the livelihoods of Korean Americans, their achieved (and sometimes tragically failed) American Dream, as well as access to food and other necessary items among lower-income people, including Black residents. “If there’s no new stores popping up, how do people access food?” Um asked. “How do people access community?\" Pictured: Protesters gather in front of a mural painted on the wall of the convenience store where Alton Sterling was shot and killed, July 6, 2016, in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Mark Wallheiser via Getty Images So, what is the legacy of the Korean American-owned liquor or convenience store? For that answer, Um reflects on those sites in general, including Cup Foods in Minnesota , the Palestinian American-owned store Floyd was killed outside of. “I think these stores are just a place where conflict does arise so often,” she said. “So, I do wonder what will happen in the future, just because now a lot of these stores are getting passed down to second-generation Korean Americans, or they’re going out of business completely.” By the end of “Liquor Store Dreams,” Um’s own parents finally sold their store. It was a bittersweet signifier of the shifting culture of stores like it. Advertisement “If there’s no new stores popping up, how do people access food?” she pondered. “How do people access community? How do you create sustainable ways that it can go for the long haul? It’s tough on both sides — being a person, a community member, and a store owner.” These are all critical questions for communities that are still repairing themselves, whether that’s due to grief over lost businesses or lives lost to suicide or gun violence. But “Liquor Store Dreams” concludes on a positive note, showing examples of understanding as well as healing. That was important for Um. Korean American audiences, in particular, have told her how much the film has opened up a dialogue among them, and how much it meant for them to hear her story along with that of her parents. “I think they’re just happy that they got to see my dad retire, even if they couldn’t see their own parents retire,” Um said. “That at the end of the day, it brought some kind of healing to them.” Related Asian Americans documentaries anti-asian racism Korean American anti-blackness Go To Homepage Candice Frederick Senior Culture Reporter Suggest a correction Popular in the Community You May Like', NULL, NULL, 'https://www.huffpost.com/entry/liquor-store-dreams-korean-anti-blackness_n_64a83101e4b0b6417636f521', '2023-07-10 04:15:16', 'united states of america', NULL, '2023-07-10 10:30:01', '2023-07-10 10:30:01', 5, NULL, '', 0),

FLAC said the figures “shine a spotlight on huge unmet legal need”. FLAC is an independent organisation that operates a legal information and referral telephone line. It also runs a nationwide network of legal advice clinics, where volunteer lawyers provide basic free legal advice. FLAC has published its annual report for 2022 and its chairperson David Fennelly said the report “underlines just how pressing a challenge access to justice remains in Ireland”. Its legal information and referral telephone line answered 13,556 calls last year, but 4,466 callers could not get through due to overwhelming demand. 30% of the 13,556 calls that were answered were family law queries in relation to topics such as divorce and separation, custody and guardianship maintenance, domestic violence, and civil partnerships. Employment law queries made up 15% of answered calls, with calls made in relation to contract terms, dismissals, bullying and harassment, discrimination, and maternity leave. FLAC expressed concern that it has nowhere to refer these 2,063 callers with employment law queries. Employment law queries are the second highest area of calls to FLAC but there is no legal aid available in employment claims before the Workplace Relations Committee. FLAC’s annual report notes: “Apart from FLAC, there is no avenue for callers who cannot afford a private solicitor (or who are not members of a trade union) to receive legal assistance. “The WRC has a statutory mandate to provide employment law information. However, we receive calls from people (including from employers) who have been referred to FLAC by the WRC.” Meanwhile, 6% of callers had a housing query, and 7% of calls were from lay litigants who are endeavouring to represent themselves. The number of calls logged last year to FLAC was the highest since 2015. Speaking to RTÉ’s Morning Ireland, FLAC CEO Eilis Barry said that the organisation has added resources to its telephone line but that it is still struggling to meet demand. “What we can tell from the tech people is that the over 4000 people who are trying to get through, they rang on a number of occasions which suggests a degree of urgency and also desperation for information and advice,” warned Barry. She also said calls expressed concern about callers seeking advice on employment law “who have nowhere to go if they can’t afford a solicitor”. “Of particular concern are people who are ringing us for advice on employment law if they’ve been sacked or if they want to bring a claim of sexual harassment, because the Legal Aid Board can’t provide representation before the Workplace Relations Commission,” said Barry. However, she said FLAC can provide legal information on its telephone lines. “But our concern is the over 2,000 callers who are looking for advice on employment law who have nowhere to go if they can’t afford a solicitor as there is no legal aid,” added Barry. “We’re also concerned about the nearly 1,000 lay litigants who ring us looking for advice, trying to navigate the complex court system. “Again, we have nowhere to send these people because they can’t afford a solicitor and they’ve been either turned down for legal aid or are not entitled to legal aid.” The FLAC CEO has called a “coming together of all of the various statutory bodies to set up some sort of system where people can get early legal advice and early legal information.” She told Morning Ireland: “We know that if you get information and advice at an early stage that can prevent catastrophes. “If you get your proper legal advice, you may get what you’re entitled to. And not only is that a benefit to the person, but it’s also a huge benefit to society. “Access to Justice should be seen as a social service like health, like education, but it isn’t and it needs to be resourced and FLAC needs to be resourced as well.”', 'https://c2.thejournal.ie/media/2023/07/river-16-7-630x411.jpg', NULL, 'https://www.thejournal.ie/flac-legal-referral-telephone-line-overwhelming-demand-6114601-Jul2023/', '2023-07-10 04:14:37', 'ireland', NULL, '2023-07-10 10:30:01', '2023-07-10 10:30:01', 2, 'legal advice', '', 0),

Rider Haggard, the perceived father of the… The post The League of of Extraordinary Gentlemen: The Movie That Ended Sean Connery’s Career appeared first on 247 News Around The World.', 'Quartermain was created by H. Rider Haggard, the perceived father of the adventure genre who wrote novels like She (1887) and King Solomon’s Mines (1885). The latter was the first Victorian adventure story set in Africa and perhaps the first “lost world” novel in which white explorers discover hidden, ancient, and primitive cultures. More progressive than other Victorians in his depictions of Africans (at least the “good ones” who aided Quartermain), it is hard to imagine Rider’s stories being adapted in the modern climate, what with for example a white queen who is “she-must-who-be-obeyed” subjugating African natives to slavery through hypnosis in She . Of course 2003 was a different era, and besides, 20th Century Fox wasn’t adapting any of the many Quartermain novels Rider wrote; rather Connery was meant to be Alan Moore’s comic book reinterpretation of the character. Supposedly. While based on a fairly literate comic series where Victorian characters like Quartermain, Oscar Wilde’s Dorian Gray, and Bram Stoker’s Mina Harker interacted, the film was produced at the beginning of the 2000s by Don Murphy (who was a few years out from his work on Michael Bay’s Transformers flicks), and developed at 20th Century Fox during the years Tom Rothman ran shop. Which is to say this was when comic book movies were treated as 90-minute time-fillers that appealed to the lowest common denominator. Think Daredevil (2003), Fantastic Four (2005), and X-Men: The Last Stand (2006). Hence the inclusion of Shane West as secret agent Tom Sawyer in LXG . The character is not in the comics (nor does his appearance as a twentysomething heartthrob make sense given the story is set in 1899 and Tom Sawyer was a young teen in 1840 in the famous Mark Twain book). But the inclusion occurred because the studio insisted American audiences wouldn’t care about the movie unless there was an American character, and preferably a young attractive one at that. Murphy initially called the change “a stupid studio note” before later stating it was “brilliant.” So how did Connery wind up in this movie? Apparently a big reason had to do with the major roles he had not played recently. In the span of three years, Connery had turned down the characters of Morpheus in The Matrix , Gandalf in The Lord of the Rings , and Dumbledore in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone . Turning away from Gandalf especially hurt since Connery was allegedly offered $30 million to play J.R.R. Tolkien’s wizard plus 15 percent of the three films’ box office—which at an ultimate tally of $2.9 billion would’ve netted Connery a cool $450 million. Looking back on the project, Connery later told The New Zealand Herald , “I read the book. I read the script. I saw the movie. I still don’t understand it. Ian McKellen, I believe, is marvelous in it.” Danofgeek', NULL, NULL, 'https://247newsaroundtheworld.com/movie-zone/the-league-of-of-extraordinary-gentlemen-the-movie-that-ended-sean-connerys-career/', '2023-07-10 04:11:26', 'united kingdom', NULL, '2023-07-10 10:30:01', '2023-07-10 10:30:01', 2, 'Movie Zone', '', 0),

Data from Binance.US shows that BTC is trading at $27,705.59 at the time of writing, around $3000 less than it sells on rival platforms like Coinbase, Kraken, BitStamp, and others. Meanwhile, this discount is also pronounced on other digital assets like Ethereum ( ETH ), USDT, Solana ( SOL ), and others, according to Coingecko data . Binance US troubles Since the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a lawsuit against Binance.US on June 5, the exchange’s market depth has fallen by almost 80% as market makers exited the platform. Following the legal troubles, the exchange discontinued U.S. dollar deposits after its banking partners abruptly halted their payment channels and transitioned to a crypto-only platform. Blockchain analytical firm Kaiko reported that this issue greatly affected Binance.US’ reputation, and its market share fell to less than 1%. Since then, the exchange has experienced high volatility with its USD pairs, with BTC spiking to as high as $138,000 on June 21. Before that, Bitcoin had traded at a 3% discount in May. Meanwhile, assets paired with stablecoins like USDT and USDC are trading at regular prices, according to data from Coingecko. Tether CTO addresses USDT trading on Binance.US Tether CTO Paolo Ardoino addressed concerns that USDT had deviated from its dollar peg. He highlighted that the deviation is exclusive to Binance.US, where a general -8% spread appears to affect all cryptocurrencies on the platform. According to Ardoino, the situation was caused by the legal challenges Binance.US was currently facing. He wrote: “Binance.US is going through some legal challenges so it probably doesn’t have many market makers willing to arbitrage at this moment in time. On Binance.com USDt is trading 1bps above the dollar.” The Tether CTO further added: “ Tether is in charge of its primary market ( http:// tether.to ). Market making secondary markets (crypto exchanges) is the role of arbitrageurs and market makering professionals.” Posted In: Bitcoin , Tether , U.S. , Exchanges Author Oluwapelumi Adejumo Journalist at CryptoSlate Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin\'s potential.
